INTRODUCTION  
  
  
Article 15(5) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1115 on the making available on the Union market and the export  
from  the  Union  of  certain  commodities  and  products  associated  with  deforestation  and  forest  
degradation and repealing Regulation (EU) No 995/2010 (hereinafter referred to as EUDR) sets out that  
the  Commission  may  develop  guidelines  in  order  to  facilitate  harmonized  implementation  of  the  
Regulation.   

This  guidance  document  is  not  legally  binding;  its  sole  purpose  is  to  provide  information  on  certain  
aspects of the EUDR. It does not replace, add to or amend the provisions of the EUDR, which establishes  
the legal obligations. This guidance document should not be considered in isolation; it must be used in  
conjunction with the legislation and not as a ‘stand-alone’ reference.   

This guidance document is, however, useful reference material for anyone who must comply with the  
EUDR as it further clarifies dedicated parts of the legislative text, meaning it can guide operators and  
traders.  It  can  also  guide  national  competent  authorities  and  enforcement  bodies  as  well  as  national  
courts in the process of implementing and enforcing the EUDR.   

The  issues  addressed  in this  document were  discussed  and  developed  in  cooperation with  designated  
representatives of the Member States. Additional issues can be addressed once there is more experience  
in applying the EUDR, and in this case the guidance document would be revised accordingly.  

For  all  issues  addressed in this  guidance document it  should be noted that in  accordance with Recital  
(43) the  definitions  of the Regulation build  on the work  of the Food  and Agriculture  Organization  of  
the United Nations (FAO), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations  
Environment Programme (UNEP), and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).  

The  second  edition  of  the  guidance  document  improves  clarity,  including  on  application  timelines,  
precision of the provisions for operators and traders, facilitating simple and efficient due diligence and  
traceability.  

The  principle  of  proportionality  is  one  of  the  general  principles  of  Union  law  which  applies  to  the  
                                                                   3 
interpretation and enforcement of Union legislation , which includes the enforcement of the provisions  
of Union acts by the Member States, taking also into account the relevant provisions of the Treaty.  

         1.   DEFINITIONS OF ‘PLACING ON THE MARKET’, ‘MAKING AVAILABLE ON  
                                                THE MARKET’ AND ‘EXPORT’  
  
Relevant legislation: EUDR – Article 2 – Definitions; Article 4 – Obligations of operators  
  
The obligations on operators that apply under Article 4 come into play  when relevant products  are  
intended  to  be  or  are  ’placed  on  the  market’  or  ‘exported ’.  The  obligations  on  traders  that  apply  
under Article 5 come into play  when relevant commodities or relevant products  are intended to be or  
are  ‘made available on the market ’ (see also Chapter 4 c) of this Guidance document).    

An overview of scenarios, explaining  the obligations which SME and non-SME operators and traders  
are  under  when placing   or  making  available  on  or  exporting  relevant products  from   the  Union  
market  is provided   in  Annex  I  of  this  Guidance  document.  The  scenarios  also  demonstrate  the  
modifications of obligations for  SME operators further  down the supply chain (Article 4(8)) and for   
non-SME operators and traders (Article 4(9)).

available here: Deforestation Regulation implementation - European Commission (europa.eu).  

                                                                  3  
﻿  
  

a)   Placing on the market   
  
Under Article 2(16),  a relevant commodity  or relevant product is  ‘placed  on the market’ if  it is made  
available on the Union market for the first time. Relevant commodities or relevant products that have  
already been placed on the Union market are not covered here. The concept of  ‘placing on the market’  
refers to each individual relevant commodity or product, not to a type of product, irrespective of whether  
it was manufactured as an individual unit or a series.  
  
b)   Making available on the market   
  
Under Article 2(18), a relevant product is ‘made available on the market’ if it is supplied:   
      •    on the Union market for distribution, consumption, or for use – this means that the relevant  
           product  or  commodity must be physically present  in the  EU, having been  either harvested  or  
           produced in the EU, or imported into the EU and placed under the customs procedure  ‘release  
           for free circulation’. As regards relevant products imported into the EU, they do not acquire the  
           status of  ‘Union goods’ before they have been brought into the customs territory of the Union  
           and  released  for  free  circulation  by  customs.  Relevant  products  placed  under  other  customs  
           procedures than the ‘release for free circulation’ (e.g. customs warehousing, inward processing,  
           temporary admission, transit) are not considered to be placed on the market under the EUDR;  
           and  
      •    in  the  course  of  a  commercial  activity –  this  means  an  activity  taking  place  in  a  business- 
           related context. Commercial activities may be in return for payment or free of charge.  Supply  
           to non-commercial consumers and activities where there is no payment made in return are both  
           within the  scope of the EUDR  (e.g. for donation or pro bono activities). The Regulation does  
           not  impose requirements  on non-commercial  consumers,  as private use  and  consumption  are  
           outside of the scope of the EUDR.  
             
“Making available on the market” should therefore be understood as occurring when a trader supplies  
relevant products on the Union market both (i) for distribution, consumption or for use and  (ii) in the  
course of its commercial activity.    
  
“Placing  on  the  market”  should  therefore  be  understood  as  occurring  when  an  operator  makes  a  
relevant product available on the Union market (i) for distribution, consumption or use, (ii) for the first  
time, and (iii) in the course of its commercial activity.  
  
The  combined  definitions  of  “operator”  (Art.  2(15)  EUDR)  and  of  ‘in  the  course  of  a  commercial  
activity’ (Art. 2(19) EUDR) imply that any person which places a relevant product on the market   
           a)  for  distribution  to  commercial  or  non-commercial  consumers,  meaning  for  example  for  
           selling or free of charge,   
           b) for the purpose of processing, or   
           c) for use in its own business   
will be subject to the due diligence requirements and needs to present a due diligence statement, unless  
a simplification applies (see Art. 4(8), 4(9) EUDR).   
  
“Relevant products entering the market” should therefore be understood as occurring when relevant  
products are simultaneously:   
      •    declared  to  be  placed  under  the  customs  procedure  ‘release  for  free  circulation’  which  are  
           intended  to  be  placed  on  the  Union  market.  Only  products  released  for  free  circulation  by  
           customs are considered placed on the Union market. Other customs procedures than the ‘release  
           for free circulation’  (e.g. customs warehousing, inward processing, temporary admission etc.)  
           are not within the scope of the EUDR.   
      •    and  

                                                                   4  
﻿  
  

      •     are  not  intended  directly  for  private  use  or  consumption  within  the  customs  territory  of  the  
            Union.  Products  intended  for  private  use  or  consumption  (e.g.  by  individual  bringing  such  
            products from a trip outside the EU for his private use or consumption) are not subject to EUDR.  
  
c)    Export  
  
Under  Article  2(37),  ‘export’  refers  to  the  customs  export  procedure  as  laid  down  in  Article  269  of  
                                           4  
Regulation (EU) No 952/2013  and refers to Union goods to be taken out of the customs territory of the  
Union.   
  
Article 269 of Regulation 952/2013 states that the export procedure shall not apply to: (a) goods placed  
under the outward processing procedure; (b) goods taken out of the customs territory of the Union after  
having been placed under the end-use procedure; (c)  goods delivered, VAT or excise duty exempted,  
as aircraft or ship supplies, regardless of the destination of the aircraft or ship, for which a proof of such  
supply is required ; (d) goods placed under the internal transit procedure; (e) goods moved temporarily  
out of the customs territory of the Union in accordance with Article  155 of Regulation 952/2013.  
  
Re-export as laid down in Article 270 of Regulation 952/2013 is not within the scope of the EUDR. Re- 
export in this regard means, that the relevant commodity or relevant product has not acquired  ‘Union  
goods’  status  and  is  taken  out  of  the  customs  territory  of  the  Union  after  lodging  e.g.  re-export  
declaration.      

  
“Relevant  products  leaving  the  market’  should  therefore  be  understood  as  occurring  when  relevant  
products are declared to be placed under the customs procedure  ‘export’ in the course of a commercial  
activity.  
  
Annex  I  of  this  guidance  includes  examples  of  how  the  interpretation  of  the  terms  ‘placing  on  the  
market’,  ‘making available’ and  ‘export’ works in practice.   
  

                                             2.   DEFINITION OF ‘OPERATOR’  
  
Relevant  legislation:  EUDR  –  Article  2(15)  –  Definitions;  Article  7  –  Placing  on  the  market  by  
operators that are established in third countries  
  
Under Article 2(15) an operator is a natural or legal person who  
      •     places relevant products on the market or exports them  
      •     in the course of a commercial activity.  
  
To make it possible to consistently identify operators, one can distinguish their roles according to how  
their relevant products  are placed  on  the Union market, which  varies  depending  on whether  they  are  
produced inside or outside the EU.  
  
      •     For  relevant  products  produced  according  to  Article  2(14)  within  the  EU,  the  operator  is  
            usually the person that distributes or uses them in the course of commercial activity once they  
            have been produced; this may be the producer or manufacturer.  
      •     A  person  that  transforms  a  relevant  product  into  another  relevant  product  (new  HS  code  
            according to the level of digits defined in Annex I of the Regulation) and places it on or exports  
            from the market is an operator further down the supply chain.  
      •     For relevant commodities or relevant products produced outside the EU:  

                                                
4 Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the  

Union Customs Code (OJ L 269,  10.10.2013, p.  1).  

                                                                        5  
﻿  
  

                    the  operator  is  the  person  acting  as  the  importer  when  the  relevant  commodities  or  
                     relevant products  are  declared to be placed under the  customs procedure  ‘release  for  
                     free  circulation’.  The  importer  is the person  indicated  in the relevant  data  element  of  
                     the customs declaration, where applicable:   
                            •     the  "importer”  in  data  element   13  04  000  000  (Annex  B  of  Delegated  
                                                                5

                    where  the  person  acting  as  the  importer  when  the  relevant  commodities  or  relevant  
                     products  are  declared  to  be  placed  under  the  customs  procedure  ‘release  for  free  
                     circulation’  is not  established  in the  EU, the  first natural  or  legal person to make the  
                     relevant products available on the market is also deemed to be an operator, i.e. although  
                     it is not an operator pursuant to the definition laid down in Article 2(15), it is subject to  
                     the obligations of an operator pursuant to Article 7. This requirement comes on top of  
                     the normal obligation of the operator established outside the Union and aims at ensuring  
                     that there is always one responsible actor established in the EU.  
      •    For relevant products imported into the EU, the definition of  ‘operator’ is independent of the  
           change of ownership of the product and of other contractual arrangements.   
      •    In  the  case  of  a  domestic  product  being  placed  on  the  market,  the  operator  is  normally  the  
           person that owns the commodity or product at the point of selling, however this may depend on  
           the individual circumstances of the contractual agreement. In case a person concludes a contract  
           by  which  it  authorises  the  other  party  to  the  contract  to  produce  a  relevant  commodity,  the  
           contracting  party  carrying  out  the  production  is  considered  the  operator  if  it  directly  and  
           automatically  becomes  the  owner  of  the  product  by  the  mere  act  of  production  (e.g.  by  the  
           harvesting  of  the  trees  or  upon  birth  of  the  calf).  This  is  not  the  case  where  the  applicable  
           national law or the contract foresee that the natural or legal person transfers, after production,  
           the right of ownership to the other party of the contract (for reference see Judgment C-370/23  
                                       6 
           of 21 November 2024 ).  
      •    For relevant products exported from the Union, the operator is usually the person acting as the  
           exporter  when  the  relevant  products  are  declared  to  be  placed  under  the  customs  export  
           procedure.  The  exporter  is  the  person  indicated  in  the  relevant  data  element  of  the  customs  
           declaration, where applicable:  
                    the  "exporter”  in  data  element  13  01  000  000  (Annex  B  of  Delegated  Regulation  
                     2015/2446);

Service  providers,  who  offer  logistical  or  technical  support  services,  for  instance  freight  forwarders,  
shipping  agents  or  customs  representatives,  who  do  not  possess  ownership  or  similar  rights  over  the  
products they handle, are neither  ‘operators’ nor  ‘traders’ for the purpose of the Regulation, if they do  
not place or make available products on the market or export.

Relevant legislation: EUDR – Article 1(2) Subject matter and scope; Article 37 – Repeal; Article 38  
– Entry into force  and date of application  
  
The EUDR entered into force on 29 June 2023. Most obligations on operators and traders, as well as on  
competent  authorities  including  those  in  Articles  3  to  13,  Articles  16  to  24,  Articles  26,  31,  and  32,  
apply  from  30  December  2025,  in  accordance  with  Regulation  (EU)  2024/3234 7  amending  the  

provisions of the EUDR relating to the date of application.  
  
For  operators that were  established  as  micro-undertakings  or  small  undertakings by  31 December  
2020 (in accordance with Article 3(1) or (2) of Directive 2013/34/EU, respectively) the obligations in  
Articles 3 to  13, Articles  16 to 24, Articles 26, 31 and 32, apply from 30 June 2026, except as regards  
the  products  covered  in  the  Annex  of  the  Regulation  No  995/2010  laying  down  the  obligations  of  
                                                                                     8 
operators  who  place  timber  and  timber  products  on  the  market  (EUTR).  This  means  that  there  is  a  
transitional period between the  entry  into  force  of the Regulation  (29 June 2023)  and the  entry into  
application (30 December 2025, deferred to 30 June 2026 for small undertakings or micro-undertakings  
established by  31 December 2020) that exempts operators and traders placing or making available on  
or export from the Union market relevant commodities and products in the transitional period from the  
main obligations under the EUDR.   
  
The following rules apply for all commodities and associated relevant products with the exception of  
timber and timber products covered by the Annex of the EUTR:   
      •    if  a relevant  commodity  or  a relevant product  is placed  on the market  during the  transitional  
           period  applying  to  the  respective  operator,  the  obligations  of  the  EUDR  do  not  apply  to  the  
           operator.  

      •    Furthermore, any relevant product placed or made available on the market after the entry into  
           application that is made entirely from commodities or products placed on the market during the  
           transitional  period  will  not  be  subject  to  the  obligations  of  the  EUDR.  This  means  that  the  
           deferred entry into application for small and micro enterprise operators (30 June 2026) will,  
           in  cases  of  them  placing  or  making  available  on  the  market,  also  exempt  medium  and  large  
           operators and traders further down the supply chain that are trading with these products or their  
           derived products.  

      •    In the cases described above, the obligation of the operators further down the supply chain (or  
           traders  making  the  relevant  product  which  has  been  placed  on  the  market  in  the  transitional  
           period available subsequently) will be limited to gathering adequately conclusive and verifiable  
           evidence  to  prove  that  the  relevant  product  was  originally  placed  on  the  market  before  the  
           (deferred) entry into application of the Regulation.  

      •    For parts of a relevant derived product that have been produced with other relevant products  
           placed  on  the  market  from  30  December  2025  (or  from  30  June  2026  by  a  micro  or  small  
           undertakings), the operators further down the supply chain placing on the market and the traders  
           will be  subject to the  standard  obligations  of the Regulation notwithstanding that  some  other  
           parts may fall into the transitional period.  

According to Article 1(2) EUDR, the EUDR does not apply if relevant products were produced before  
29 June 2023. The time and place of production refers to the production date and production place of  
the relevant commodity, this applies both for the commodities and the derived products. In most cases,  
the production date will be the time of harvest of the commodity, with the exception of cattle products  
in which case the relevant time of production starts on the date on which the cattle is born.

Q1:  Are  paper  products  which  are  placed  on  the  market  from  30  December  2025  but  that  are  
manufactured from timber that was harvested  and placed on the market between 29 June 2023

In such cases the harvested timber and the products manufactured from such timber must comply with  
EUTR. They do not need a Due Diligence  Statement, as this requirement applies to products in scope

Relevant legislation: EUDR – Article 2(26) - Definitions; Article 4 – Obligations of operators, Article  
8 – Due diligence; Article 9 – Information requirements; Article 10 – Risk assessment  
  
According to Article 4(1) operators  shall  exercise  due  diligence in  accordance with Article  8 prior to  
placing relevant products on the market or exporting them in order to prove that the relevant products  
comply with Article 3. In order to do so, and in accordance with Article  12(1) of EUDR, operators shall  
establish  and keep up to  date  a  framework  of procedures  and measures –  a  ‘due  diligence  system’ in  
accordance with Article  12 (1) of the EUDR – to exercise due diligence in accordance with Article 8 to  
ensure that the relevant products they place on the market or export comply with Article 3 of the EUDR.  
Operators  are  responsible  for  a  thorough  examination  and  analysis  of  their  own  business  activities,  
which requires the collection of relevant data, analysing it, and – as necessary – adopt risk mitigation  
measures, unless the risk  of non-compliance  is  assessed  as being negligible.  The  data  collection, risk  
analysis,  and  risk  mitigation  must  be  causally  related,  and  must  reflect  the  characteristics  of  the  
operator's business activities and of the supply chains.  
  
Operators have to  specify the risk assessment criteria according to Article  10(2), which they consider  
in relation to the relevant products they intend to place on or export from the Union market. Therefore,  
the risk assessment criteria has to be tailored to the relevant products the operator intends to place on or  
export from the market.   
  
a)   Risk assessment   
  
The due diligence requirements set out in Article 8 requires the operator to:  
     •     collect  information,  documents  and  data  from  each  particular  supplier  about  the  relevant  
          products which are subject to the EUDR (listed in Annex I) pursuant to Article 8 and 9,   

                                                                 9  
﻿  
  

      •    verify and analyse that information along with other contextual information and on that basis  
           carry out a risk assessment pursuant to Article  10, and   
      •    adopt risk mitigation measures pursuant to Article  11, unless the risk assessment carried out in  
           accordance with Article  10  concludes that there is no or  only negligible risk that the relevant  
           products are non-compliant.   
  
Article 9(1) specifies the product-related information that must be assessed, which includes information  
specific to the product and its supply chain. Article 10(2) identifies the additional contextual information  
needed to assess the level of risk, such as the state of forests within the country of production.  
  
If the products are made with commodities that are derived from several sources or geolocations, it is  
necessary to assess the risk for each source or geolocation.  
  
On the basis of the collected data, precisely defined risk analysis tasks must be performed and the risk  
categories must be determined, as well as the necessary risk mitigation measures related to them. The  
level  of risk  can  only be assessed  on  a case-by-case basis by  operators,  as  it  depends  on a number  of  
factors.    
  
There are various ways to conduct the risk assessment, but the operator has to address the criteria listed  
in Article  10(2) for each relevant product. This should include addressing the following questions and  
considerations:  
  
      •    Where was the product produced?  
           What is the assigned risk level of the country of production or parts thereof, in accordance with  
                          9 
           Article  29  ?    What  is  the  rate  of  forest  cover  and  what  is  the  prevalence  (rate)  of  forest  
           degradation  or  deforestation  in  the  country  of  production  or  parts  thereof?  How  high  is  the  
           prevalence  (rate)  of  illegal  production  of  the  relevant  commodity  within  the  country/parts  
           thereof?   
             
      •    What are the product-specific risks?  
           There are considerable differences in how the various relevant products listed in EUDR Annex  
           I  are  produced,  which  will  impact  the  risk  of  non-compliance.  For  example,  some  products  
           contain  raw  material  produced  in  hundreds  of  separate  geolocations  or  undergo  substantial  
           chemical or physical procedures during the manufacturing.  
             
      •    Is the supply chain complex?  

           For clarification of the  ‘complexity of supply chain’ concept, see Section 5.    
  
      •    Are there indications of a company in the supply chain being involved in practices related  
           to illegality, deforestation or forest degradation?  
           There is a higher risk that relevant commodities or products purchased from a company that has  
           been associated with illegal practices, deforestation or forest degradation will be non-compliant.  
           Have  any  substantiated  concerns  been  submitted  regarding  companies  in  the  supply  chain  
           pursuant to Article 31? Have any companies within the supply chain breached relevant laws10  

           and been sanctioned by the state for the breach of such laws?   
  
      •    Is there  any  complementary information  on EUDR  compliance  of  companies within the  
           supply chain available from certification or third-party verification schemes?  
           For clarification of the role of third-party verification schemes, see Section  10.  
  

                                               
9 Note that if no specific risk level has been assigned, countries are considered standard risk.  
10 Those related to illegality, deforestation, and forest degradation.  

                                                                     10  
﻿  
  

      •    Have the relevant products been produced in accordance with the relevant legislation of  
           the country of production?  
           The  relevant  legislation  of  the  country  of  production  is  defined  in  Article  2(40).  For  further  
           information about legality requirements please see Section 6.  
             
      •    Is there concern in relation to the country of production and origin or parts thereof, such  
           as  level  of  corruption,  prevalence  of  document  and  data  falsification,  lack  of  law  
           enforcement,  violations  of  international  human  rights,  armed  conflict  or  prevalence  of  
           sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council or the Council of the European Union?  
           These concerns might undermine the reliability of  some documents showing compliance with  
           applicable legislation. Therefore, the country’s corruption level, business risk indices, and other  
           relevant indicators should be considered.  

      •    Are all documents showing compliance with applicable legislation made available by the  
           supplier, and are they verifiable immediately?  
           If all relevant documents are ready and available upon operators’ request, then it is more likely  
           that the supply chain is well established and the supplier is aware of the EUDR requirements.  

  
b)   Negligible risk  
  
The concept of negligible risk should be understood in accordance with Article 2(26) which means that  
on the basis of a full assessment of product-specific and general information pursuant to Article 10, and,  
where necessary, of the application of the appropriate mitigation measures pursuant to Article  11, the  
commodities  or  products  show  no  cause for   concern  as  being  not  in  compliance  with  Article  3(a)  
(deforestation-free) or (b) (produced legally, in accordance with the applicable legislation in the country  
of production).  
  
The  list  of risk  assessment  criteria  in  Article  10(2)  is not  exhaustive;  operators may  choose to  apply  
further criteria if these would help determine the likelihood that a relevant commodity or product had  
been illegally produced or was not deforestation-free, or if it would help prove legal or deforestation- 
free production.  
  
According to Article 13, SME and non-SME operators sourcing from low-risk countries are not required  
to  fulfil the  obligations under Article  10  and Article  11  in  order to  achieve  a negligible risk,  after,  in  
accordance with Article  13(1) having  (i) assessed the complexity of the relevant supply chain and the  
risk of circumvention or mixing with products of unknown origin and (ii) ascertained that all relevant  
commodities and products they place on the market or export have been produced exclusively in such  
countries or parts thereof that were classified as low risk in accordance with Article 2911. However, the  

steps described in Articles  10 and  11 apply if an operator sourcing from a low-risk country obtains or  
is made aware of any information that would point to a risk of non-compliance or circumvention, see  
Article 13(2).  Without prejudice to the obligations the operator has under Article 13, for the information  
collection required by Article 9(1)(g) and Article 9(1)(h) of the EUDR, it is generally sufficient that the  
information is independently verifiable and conclusive in itself. The operator could do that for instance  
by ensuring that the product related information is internally consistent. No further steps of assessing  
the  information  are  required  unless,  in  the  course  of  information  collection  or  in  the  course  of  the  
assessment  required  by  Article  13  of  the  EUDR  itself,  operators  are  made  aware  of  relevant  new  
information indicating that a relevant product that they intend to place on the market or export is at risk  
of not complying with the Regulation.  

                                             
11 According to Article 29(2), the Commission will present a list of countries or parts thereof that present a low  

or high risk by means of implementing acts.  

                                                                  11  
﻿  
  

For non-SME operators further down a supply chain, the simplification under Art. 4(9) can also apply,  
meaning the non-SME operators in this case merely have to ascertain that due diligence was properly  
carried out upstream. Ascertaining that due diligence was properly carried out may not necessarily imply  
having to systematically check every single due diligence statement submitted upstream. For example,  
the downstream non-SME operator could verify that upstream operators have an operational and up-to- 
date  due  diligence  system  in  place,  including  adequate  and  proportionate  policies,  controls,  and  
procedures  to  mitigate  and  manage  effectively  the  risks  of  non-compliance  of  relevant  products,  to  
ensure that due diligence is properly and regularly exercised.   
  
In case the risk assessment and risk mitigation exercise concludes that any of the risk criterion reveal a  
non-negligible  level  of  risk,  then  the  product  should  be  deemed  as  carrying  a  non-negligible  risk,  
therefore the operator shall not place it on or export it from the Union market.  
  
c)    Role of SME and non-SME traders  
  
Traders,  according  to  Article  2(17)  are  persons  in  the  supply  chain  other  than  operators  who,  in  the  
course of a commercial activity, make relevant products available on the market.  
Whether a trader is subject to due diligence obligations depends on whether the trader is an SME or not,  
which  is  determined  according  to  the  criteria  set  out  in  Article  3  of  Directive  2013/34/EU  of  the  
European Parliament and the Council, see Art. 2(30) of the EUDR.  
  
If  the  trader  is  a  non-SME,  according  to  Article  5(1),  obligations  and  provisions  for  non-SME  
operators  apply,  meaning  that  the  non-SME  trader  must  ascertain  that  due  diligence  was  exercised  
upstream (see the previous subchapter).  
  
For  SME  traders,  the  applicable  obligations  are  set  out  in  Art.  5(2)  to  (6)  of  the  Regulation.  SME  
traders  shall  make  available  relevant  products  on  the  market  only  if  they  are  in  possession  of  the  
information required under Article  5  (3),  essentially the  identity  of their  suppliers  and their  corporate  
clients and the reference numbers of due diligence statements associated to the products.  SME traders  
do  not  need  to  exercise  due  diligence  and  do  not  need  to  ascertain  that  due  diligence  was  exercised  
upstream. Their obligation is to maintain traceability of the relevant products, meaning they must collect  
and keep information as well as make it available to competent authorities upon request to demonstrate  
compliance.    
  
d)   Interplay with Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive   
  
The  Directive  2024/1760  on  corporate  sustainability  due  diligence12 (CSDDD)  establishes  a  general  

horizontal  framework  for  sustainability  due  diligence  for very  large  EU  and non-EU  companies.  The  
EUDR provides  a  sectoral  framework  for  deforestation regarding  certain  aspects  of  due  diligence  for  
certain  products.  The  CSDDD  and  EUDR  have  different  scopes  but  are  largely  complementary,  and  
both should be applied in a coherent manner to ensure effective due diligence. Where the specific due  
diligence rules under the EUDR conflict with the general rules of the CSDDD, the EUDR's provisions,  
being  lex specialis,  prevail  over  the  general  rules  of  the  CSDDD  (lex generalis)  to  the  extent  of  the  
conflict,  insofar  as  they  provide  for  more  extensive  or  more  specific  obligations  pursuing  the  same  
objectives. This rule is set out in Art.  1(3) CSDDD and it follows the principles of EU law, which give  
precedence to lex specialis over lex generalis in such cases.

12 Directive (EU) 2024/1760 of the European Parliament and of the Council of  13 June 2024 on corporate

2024/1760, 5.7.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2024/1760/oj .  

                                                                     12  
﻿  
  

Relevant legislation: EUDR - Article 8 - Due diligence; Article 9 – Information requirements; Article  
10 – Risk assessment; Article 11 – Risk mitigation  

‘Complexity of the relevant supply chain’ is explicitly listed as a risk assessment criterion in Article  
10(2)(i) of the EUDR and is therefore relevant to the risk assessment and risk mitigation part of the  
due diligence exercise. It is one of  several criteria of the risk assessment and risk mitigation part of  
the due diligence exercise set out in Article  10 and  11.   
  
The  rationale  underpinning  this  criterion  is  that  tracing  relevant  products  back  to  the  country  of  
production  and plots  of  land where the relevant  commodities were produced may be more  difficult  if  
the  supply  chain  is  complex,  and  this  is  a  factor  which  is  associated  with  a  greater  risk  of  non- 
compliance. Inconsistency of the relevant information and data and problems obtaining the necessary  
information  at  any  point  in  the  supply  chain  can  increase  the  risk  of  non-compliant  commodities  or  
products entering the supply chain. The main consideration is the extent to which it is possible to trace  
the relevant commodities found in a relevant product back to the plots of land where they were produced.   
  
The  risk  of  non-compliance  will  increase  if  the  complexity  of  the  supply  chain  makes  it  difficult  to  
identify the information required under Article  9(1) and Article  10(2) of the EUDR. The existence of  
unidentified  steps  in the  supply  chain  or  any  other  finding  indicating non-compliance  can  lead to the  
conclusion that the risk is non-negligible.  
  
The complexity of the supply chain increases with the number of processors and intermediaries between  
the plots of land in the country of production and the operator or trader. Complexity may also increase  
when  more  than  one  relevant  product  is  used  to  manufacture  a  new  relevant  product,  or  if  relevant  
commodities  are  sourced  from multiple  countries  of production.  On the other hand, the  due  diligence  
exercise is likely to be simpler in short supply chains, and a short supply chain may, particularly in the  
case of simplified due diligence under Article  13, be one factor that helps to demonstrate that there is a  
negligible risk of circumvention of the Regulation.   
  
In order to assess the complexity of the supply chain, operators and traders may use the following (non- 
exhaustive)  list  of  questions  for relevant products to be placed  on,  or made  available  on,  or  exported  
from the Union market:  
  
      •    Were  there  several  processors  and/or  steps  in  the  supply  chain  before  a  particular  relevant  
           product was placed on, or made available on, or exported from the Union market?  
      •    Does  the  relevant  product  contain  relevant  commodities  sourced  from  several  plots  and/or  
           countries of production?  
      •    Is  the  relevant  product  a  highly  processed  product  (which  may  itself  contain  multiple  other  
           relevant products)?   
      •    For timber,   
                 o    does the relevant product consist of more than one tree species?  
                 o    have the timber and/or timber products been traded in more than one country?   
                 o    were  any  relevant  processed  products  processed  or  manufactured  in  third  countries  
                      before they were placed on, or made available on or exported from the Union market?   
  

                                                          6.   LEGALITY   
  
Relevant legislation: EUDR – Article 2(40) – Definitions and Article 3(b) – Prohibition  
  
According to Article 3 of the EUDR, relevant commodities and relevant products shall not be placed or  
made available on the market or exported, unless all the following conditions are fulfilled:  

      a)   they are deforestation-free,   

                                                                    13  
﻿  
  

     b)   they  have  been  produced  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  legislation  of  the  country  of  
           production, and   
     c)    they are covered by a due diligence statement.   

Relevant products must meet all three criteria separately and individually; otherwise, operators and  
non-SME traders shall refrain from placing or making them available on the market or exporting them.  
  
a)   Relevant legislation of the country of production  
  
The  basis for  determining whether a  relevant commodity  or  relevant  product  has  been  produced  in  
accordance with the relevant legislation of the country of production is the legislation of the country in  
which the commodity, or in the case of a product, the commodity contained in a relevant product was  
grown,  harvested,  obtained  from  or  raised  on  relevant  plots  of  land  or,  as  regards  cattle,  in  
establishments.  

The EUDR takes a flexible approach by listing a number of areas of law without specifying particular  
laws, as these differ from country to country and may be subject to amendments. However, only the  
applicable laws concerning the legal status of the area of production constitute relevant legislation  
pursuant to Article 2(40) of the EUDR. This means that generally the relevance of laws for the legality  
requirement in Article 3(b) of the EUDR is not determined by the fact that they may apply generally  
during the production process of commodities or apply to the supply chains of relevant products and  
relevant commodities, but by the fact that these laws specifically impact or influence the legal status of  
the area in which the commodities were produced.   

Additionally, Article 2(40) of the EUDR must be read in the light of the objectives of the EUDR as laid  
down in Article 1(1)(a) and (b), meaning that legislation is also relevant if its contents can be linked to  
halting deforestation and forest degradation in the context of the Union’s commitment to address climate  
change and biodiversity loss.  

Points (a) to (h) of Article 2(40) further specify this relevant legislation. The following list gives some  
concrete examples which are for illustration purposes only and cannot be considered exhaustive:  

      •    Land use rights , including laws on harvesting and producing on the land or on the management  
           of the land; such as  
                ▪    legislation on land transfer in particular for agricultural land or forests,  
                ▪    legislation on land lease transaction.  
             
      •    Environmental   protection .   A   link   to   the   objective   of   halting   deforestation   and   forest  
           degradation, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions or the protection of biodiversity exists,  
           for example, in   
                ▪    legislation on protected areas,  
                ▪    legislation on nature protection and nature restoration,  
                ▪    legislation on the protection and conservation of wildlife and biodiversity,  
                ▪    legislation on endangered species,  
                ▪    legislation on land development.  
                       
      •    Forest-related  rules,  including  forest  management  and  biodiversity  conservation,  where  
           directly related to wood harvesting, such as  
                ▪    legislation  on  the  protection  and  conservation  of  forests,  and  sustainable  forest  
                     management,   
                ▪    anti-deforestation legislation,  
                ▪    rights to harvest timber within the legally gazetted boundaries.  
             

                                                                  14  
﻿  
  

     •     Third  parties’  rights,  including  rights  to  use  and  tenure  affected  by  producing  the  relevant  
           commodities  and  products,  and  traditional  land  use  rights  of  indigenous  peoples  and  local  
           communities; this may include e.g. rights to land charge or usufructuary rights.   
                       
     •     Labour rights  and human rights protected under international law, applying either to people  
           being present in the area of  production of relevant commodities to the extent relevant to the  
           EUDR taking into account its objectives as enshrined in Article  1(1) of the EUDR, or to people  
           with rights to the area of production of relevant commodities or products, including indigenous  
           peoples’ and  local  communities’  rights, if  they  are  applicable  or  reflected  in  the  respective  
           national legislation; for example rights to land, territories and resources, property rights, rights  
           in  relation  to  treaties,  agreements  and  other  constructive  arrangements  between  indigenous  
           peoples and States.               
                             
     •     The  principle  of  free,  prior  and  informed  consent  (FPIC),  including  as  set  out  in  the  UN  
           Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . Further guidance as to the application of the  
           FPIC principle can e.g. be found through the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human  
           Rights where it is noted that  States must have consent as the objective of consultation before  
           any of the following actions are taken:  
                ▪    the undertaking of projects that affect indigenous peoples’ rights to land, territory and  
                     resources, including mining and other utilization or exploitation of resources,   
                ▪    the relocation of indigenous peoples from their land or territories,  
                ▪    restitution  or  other  appropriate  redressing  if  lands  have  been  confiscated,  taken,  
                     occupied or damaged without the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous people  
                     who possessed it.  
             
     •     Tax, anti-corruption, trade and customs regulations.  
                ▪    Applicable  laws  concerning the relevant  supply chains  entering the Union market,  or  
                     leaving it, if they have a specific link to the objectives of the Regulation, or, in the case  
                     of  trade  and  customs  laws,  if  they  specifically  concern  the  relevant  sectors  of  
                     agricultural or timber production.  
  
b)   Due diligence regarding legality  
  
Operators must be aware of what legislation exists in each of the countries they are sourcing from as to  
the legal status of the area of production. The relevant legislation can, among others, consist of:  
     •     National and regional laws, including relevant secondary legislation,  
     •     International  law,  including  multi-  and  bilateral  treaties  and  agreements,  as  applicable  in  
           domestic law by codifying and implementing them, respectively.  

Under Article 9(1)(h) of the EUDR, information, including documents and data showing compliance  
with applicable legislation in the country of production, must be collected as part of the due diligence  
obligation.  This  includes  information  related  to  any  arrangement  conferring  the  right  to  use  the  
respective area for the purposes of the production of the relevant commodity. Whether a land title or  
other documentation of an arrangement is needed is dependent on the national legislation; if possession  
of a land title is not required under domestic law to produce and commercialise agricultural products, it  
is not required under the EUDR.  

The obligation to collect documents or other information depends on the different regulatory regimes  
of countries, as not all of them require the issuing of specific documentation. Therefore, the obligation  
should be understood as including, where applicable:   

     •     Official documents issued by countries’ authorities, such as e.g. administrative permits,   

                                                                  15  
﻿  
  

     •     Documents   showing   contractual   obligations,   including   contracts   and   agreements   with  
           indigenous peoples or local communities,  
     •     Complementary  information  issued  by  public  and  private  certification  or  other  third-party  
           verified schemes,   
     •     Judicial decisions,  
     •     Impact assessments, management plans, environmental audit reports.  
  
The following additional documents can be also useful:  

     •     Documents showing company policies and codes of conduct,  
     •     Voluntary self-declaration of producers of relevant commodities in which a producer declares  
           that the product was produced in compliance with the legislation of the country of production,  
     •     Social responsibility agreements between private actors and third right holders,                           
     •     Specific reports on tenure and rights claims and conflicts.  
  
Information, including documents and data, may be collected in hard copy or in electronic form.   

It is important to note that the information, including documents and data, must be collected under  
Article 9(1)(h) of the EUDR also for the purposes of the risk assessment (Article 10 of the EUDR) and  
should not be viewed as an independent requirement, unless the product is sourced entirely from low- 
risk countries or parts thereof. In the case of sourcing entirely from low-risk countries or parts thereof13,  

according to Article 13 of the EUDR, SME and non-SME operators must only carry out the following  
steps describing the risk assessment if the operators obtain or are made aware of information pointing  
to a risk of non-compliance or circumvention.  

According to  Article 10(1) of the EUDR, the information collected must be assessed as a whole to  
ensure traceability and compliance throughout the supply chain. All information must be analysed and  
verified, meaning operators must be able to evaluate the content and reliability of the documents they  
collect and to understand the links between the different information in different documents. Usually,  
the operator should check as part of the assessment:  

     •     Whether  the  different  documents  are  in  line  with  each  other  and  with  other  information  
           available,   
     •     What exactly each document proves,   
     •     On which system (e.g. control by authorities, independent audit, etc.) the document is based,   
     •     The reliability and validity of each document, meaning the likelihood of it being falsified or  
           issued unlawfully.   
  
Operators  should  take  reasonable  measures  to  satisfy  themselves  that  such  documents  are  genuine,  
depending on their assessment of the general situation in the country of production. In this regard, the  
operator should also take into account the risk of corruption (e.g. bribery, collusion, or fraud). Various  
sources provide generally available information about the level of corruption in a country or subnational  
region,  for  example  Transparency  International’s  Corruption  Perceptions  Index,  or  other  similar  
recognised international indices or relevant information14.  

In cases where the level of corruption is considered high there might be an implication that documents  
cannot be considered reliable, and further verification may be required. In the occurrence of such cases  

                                            
13 According to Article 29(2), the Commission will present a list of countries or parts thereof, that present a low  

or high risk by means of implementing acts.  
14 For the use of such indices see also Chapter 4 of Commission Notice of  12.2.2016, C(2016)755 final  

(Guidance Document for the EU Timber Regulation).  

                                                                 16  
﻿  
  

 special  care  is  necessary  when  checking  the  documents  as  there  might  be  reason  to  doubt  their  
credibility.   

Apart from relying on recognised international indices, operators could check lists of conditions and  
vulnerabilities, including previous evidence of corrupt practice, that point to a greater risk  -  and thus  
demand  a  higher  level  of  scrutiny.  Examples  of  such  additional  evidence  may  include  third-party- 
verified schemes (see Section 10 of this guidance), independent or self-conducted audits, or the use of  
technologies/forensic methods tracking the relevant products which can help to reveal indications of  
corruptions or illegalities.  

Downstream non-SME operators and non-SME traders are under the obligation to ascertain that due  
diligence, including on legality, has been exercised by the upstream operator, see Article 4(9) of the  
EUDR. When collecting information, documentation and data for this purpose, downstream operators  
and traders should respect the applicable data protection rules and competition rules.  
  

                                                    7.    PRODUCT SCOPE  
  
 a)   Clarification – Packing and packaging materials   
  
Relevant legislation: EUDR - Article 2 -Definitions; Annex I to the EUDR   
  
Annex I of the EUDR sets out the list of relevant commodities and relevant products as classified in the  
Combined Nomenclature set out in Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/8715.  

  
HS  Code  4819  covers:              ‘Cartons,  boxes,  cases,  bags  and  other  packing   containers,  of  paper,   
paperboard,  cellulose wadding or webs of cellulose fibres;  box files,  letter trays, and similar articles,  
of paper  or paperboard  of a kind used in offices, shops or the like’.  
      •    If any of the above articles are placed on the market or exported as products in their own right,  
           rather than  as packing  for  another product, they  are  covered by the Regulation  and therefore  
           the obligations set out in EUDR apply.  
      •    If  packing  material,  as  classified  under  HS  code  4819,  is  used  to  ‘support,  protect  or  carry’  
           another product, it is not covered by the Regulation.  
  
HS  Code  4415  covers:  ‘Packing  cases,  boxes,  crates,  drums  and  similar packings,   of  wood;  cable- 
drums of wood; pallets,  box pallets  and other load boards, of wood; pallet  collars of wood’.  
      •    If any of the above articles are placed on the market or exported as products in their own right,  
           they are covered by the Regulation and therefore the obligations set out in EUDR apply.  
      •    Articles under  4415 used  exclusively  as packing material to  support, protect  or  carry  another  
           product placed on the market are not covered by EUDR.  
  
Within  these  categories,  there  is  a  further  distinction  between  packing  that  is  considered  to  give  a  
product its  ‘essential character’ and packing which is shaped and fitted to a specific product but is not  
an  integral part  of the product  itself.  General rule  5  on  interpreting the  Combined Nomenclature16 of  

Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 clarifies these differences, and examples are presented below. Containers  
with an  ‘essential character’ are assigned their own HS code and are classified independently from the  
product they contain and are in scope of the Regulation, while containers specially shaped or fitted to  
contain  specific articles  are  assigned the HS  Code of the product they  contain,  if these  containers are  
 suitable for long-term use, presented with the articles for which they are intended and when of a kind  
normally sold therewith are not in scope of the Regulation (General Rule 5a). Ordinary packaging, such  

                                              
 15 Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July  1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the  

Common Customs Tariff (OJ L 256, 7.9.1987, p.  1)   
 16 Explanatory notes to the Combined Nomenclature of the European Union (OJ C  119, 29.3.2019, p.1)  

                                                                    17

                                                                    7 
as packaging materials and packaging containers  presented with the  goods therein  shall be  classified  
with the goods if they are of a kind normally used for packaging such goods, meaning they are not in  
scope of the Regulation (General Rule 5b). Paper or other materials of wrapping should be considered  
an integral part of a product if its purpose is to protect, carry or transport it.  
  
However,  these  additional  distinctions  are  only  likely  to  be  relevant  to  a  small  proportion  of  goods  
subject to the Regulation.  
  
In summary, the following is subject to the Regulation:  
      •    Packing material placed or made available on the market or exported as products in their own  
           right;  
      •    Containers which give a product its essential character.  
             
The following is not subject to the Regulation:  
      •    Packing material presented with goods inside and used exclusively to support, protect or carry  
           another product.  
  
b)   Clarification – Waste and recovered and recycled products  
  
Relevant  legislation: EUDR  - Recital  (40); Annex I  to  the EUDR; Directive 2008/98/EC - Article  
3(1)  
  
Operators and traders handle during their economic activities used products that have completed their  
lifecycle, and which would otherwise be disposed of as waste. Waste means a substance or object which  
the  holder  discards  or  intends  or  is  required  to  discard  (Directive  2008/98/EC,  Article  3(1)).  Such  
products  are  excluded  from  the  scope  of  the  EUDR.  This  means  that  such  operators  and  traders  are  
exempted from the obligations of the EUDR in these cases.   
  
This exemption applies to goods that have been produced entirely from a material that has completed  
its lifecycle and would otherwise have been discarded as waste (e.g. timber retrieved from dismantled  
buildings, or goods made from coffee chaff).  
This exemption does not apply to by-products of a manufacturing process that involves material that is  
not waste in the sense of being a substance or object which the holder discards or intends or is required  
to discard.  
  
Q1:  Are  wood  chips  and  sawdust  produced  as  by-products  of  sawmilling  subject  to  the  
Regulation?  
Yes, these are in scope under HS code 4401 which is subject to the EUDR. This is because wood chips  
and sawdust may be used as fuelwood and therefore have not completed their lifecycle. An exception  
would be wood chips/sawdust used exclusively as packing material to support, protect or carry another  
product.   
  
Q2:  Is  furniture  made  from  timber  recovered  after  the  demolition  of  a  house  subject  to  the  
Regulation?  
No,  if  these  products  are  made  entirely  from  material  that  has  completed  its  lifecycle  and  would  
otherwise have been discarded as waste, they are not subject to the Regulation. However, if the products  
contain any amount of non-recycled material, that part would be subject to the Regulation.  
  
Q3: Are products made from recycled or recovered material subject to the Regulation?  
No, if the relevant products are made entirely from recycled material, they are not subject to the EUDR.  
However, if the relevant products contain any amount of non-recycled or non-recovered material, that  
amount would be subject to the Regulation, such as virgin pulp use in paper production, and timber used  
to repair pallets.  
  

                                                                     18  
﻿  
  

Q4:  Are  fuel  pellets  made  from  empty  fruit  bunches  or  palm  kernel  shells  subject  to  the  
Regulation?  
Yes,  where  empty  fruit  bunches  and  palm  kernel  shells,  even  in  pellet  form,  are  classified  as  solid  
residue by-products of the palm oil extraction process, fuel pellets made from them are covered under  
HS  code  2306  60  in  Annex  I  of the  EUDR.  Fuel pellets  are not  subject to the  Regulation  if they  are  
made entirely from materials classified as waste.  
  
Q5: Are products made from recycled cattle leather subject to the Regulation?  
No, if the leather within the product is entirely recycled then it is not subject to the EUDR. However, if  
the products contain any amount of non-recycled leather, that leather would be subject to the Regulation.  
  
Q6: Are used coffee grounds, for use in toiletries or fertiliser, subject to the Regulation?  
No, if the grounds are waste from a café, for example, and would otherwise have been discarded.  
  
Q7: Are relevant products covered by the EUDR in case they are produced from non-relevant  
commodities?  
The Regulation does not apply to products which are made of non-relevant commodities, even if those  
products  present  the  same  Combined  Nomenclature  as  the  relevant  products  made  of  relevant  
commodities. The Regulation only applies to relevant products made of relevant commodities.  
  
That is the case for example:  
    i.     palm oil from oil palm species of Elaeis spp. (including Elaeis guineensis) is in the scope of the  
           EUDR,  however  babassu  oil  from  genus Attalea spp.  (including Attalea speciosa)  and  other  
           vegetable oils from other palm tree species are not in the scope of the EUDR;  

   ii.     rubber  from Hevea  brasiliensis  is  in  the  scope,  but  balata,  gutta-percha,  guayule,  chicle  and  
           similar natural gums produced with other species are not in the scope of the EUDR, neither are  
           synthetic rubber products;  

  iii.     products  of  wood  are  in  the  scope,  but  the  products  made  from  rattan,  bamboo,  and  other  
           materials of woody nature are not in the scope of the EUDR.  

             

                   8.   REGULAR MAINTENANCE OF A DUE DILIGENCE SYSTEM  
  
Relevant legislation: EUDR - Article 12 – Establishment and maintenance of due diligence systems,  
reporting and record keeping  
  
To exercise due diligence in accordance with Article 8, operators must establish and keep up to date a  
framework of documenting, analysing, verifying and reporting procedures and measures ('due diligence  
system').  The  aim  of  due  diligence under the  EUDR  is  to  achieve  a required  outcome by  evidencing  
consistent processes  in businesses  operations. It is important that in accordance with Article  12(2)  an  
operator shall review its due diligence system at least once a year to ensure that those responsible are  
following  the  procedures  that  apply  to  them,  the  processes  in  place  are  effective  and  the  required  
outcome is being achieved. Operators should also update the due diligence system if during the review  
or  at  any  other point they become  aware  of new  developments which  could influence the aims of the  
due  diligence  system,  such  as the  effectiveness  and  comprehensiveness  of  steps or procedures within  
the system. Any updates to the due diligence system must be recorded and records kept for 5 years.   
  
The  review  can  be  carried  out  by  someone  within  the  organisation  of  the  operator  (should  be  
independent  from  those  carrying  out  the  procedures)  or  by  an  external  body.  It  should  identify  any  
weaknesses and failures and the operator’s management should set deadlines for addressing them.  
  

                                                                    19  
﻿  
  

In the case of a relevant product due diligence system, the review should for example check if there are  
documented procedures:  
      •    For  collecting  and  recording  the  information,  data  and  documents  necessary  to  demonstrate  
           compliance.  
      •    For  assessing  the  risk  of  the  relevant  product  or  any  component  of  the  relevant  product  
           containing relevant products or relevant commodities that are not deforestation-free or have not  
           been produced in accordance with the relevant legislation of the country of production.  
      •    Describing proposed actions to take according to the level of risk.  
  
The review should also check if those who are responsible for carrying out each step in the procedures  
both understand and are implementing each step, and that there are adequate controls to ensure that the  
procedures are effective in practice (i.e. that they identify and result in the exclusion of relevant product  
that pose a non-negligible risk of non-compliance). Good practice suggests that to evidence the review,  
the steps followed in, and outcomes of, the review are documented.   
  

                                              9.   COMPOSITE PRODUCTS  
  
Relevant  legislation:  EUDR  –  Article  4  –  Obligations  of  operators;  Article  9  –  Information  
requirements; Article 33 – Information system  
  
Operators and traders may deal with relevant products, as listed in Annex I of the EUDR, that contain  
or are made partly from other relevant products or relevant commodities. In practice these are sometimes  
referred to as  ‘composite products’ although this is not a legal term used in the EUDR.    
The  EUDR  sets  out  rules  to  ensure  that  the  relevant  commodities  and  relevant  products  that  are  
contained in relevant products, or from which relevant products are made, are properly identified in the  
course of the operator's due diligence pursuant to Article 8. This is necessary to ensure that all relevant  
products are in compliance with the Regulation.  
  
Operators need to meet the information requirements listed under Article 9 as part of their due diligence  
for the relevant products they  are placing  on  or  exporting  from the market.   It may  in  some  cases be  
complex to identify the species, origin and geolocations of relevant commodities contained in relevant  
products, particularly for reconstituted products such as paper, fibreboard and particleboard, or highly  
processed products, such as food preparations containing cocoa, but this information is required for the  
products  to  be  placed  on  the  market  or  exported.  For  further  reference  please  see  Annex  II  of  this  
Guidance document.  
  
In  addition, when placing on the Union market  or exporting relevant products, if these  contain or  are  
made from other relevant products (as listed in Annex I of the EUDR) that had not been subject to due  
diligence before, then the  operator must conduct  due  diligence on those parts  of the relevant product.  
This applies to both SME and non-SME operators (Article 4(8) and (9)).     
  
Composite products may contain multiple relevant products under different commodities. For instance,  
a chocolate bar [HS 1806] may comprise derived products of cocoa (cocoa powder [HS 1805] and cocoa  
butter [HS  1804]) and oil palm (palm oil [HS  1511]). In such cases, the operator placing the product on  
the  EU  market  or  exporting  from  it  will  only  be  required  to  conduct  due  diligence  on  the  relevant  
products  listed  under  the  commodity  deemed  relevant  in  Annex  I  of  the  EUDR.  For  instance,  for  
chocolate bars [HS1806], the relevant commodity linked to it is cocoa. This means that the due diligence  
obligation and information requirements extend only to relevant products listed in the right column of  
Annex I under the relevant commodity which the chocolate bar contains or has been made using, which  
in this case is the cocoa powder and cocoa butter under the commodity cocoa.  

  

                                                                  20  
﻿  
  

a)   Information requirements   
  
As part of their due diligence pursuant to Article 8, operators, when describing their relevant products,  
in  accordance  with  the  information  requirements  under  Article  9,  need  to  include  the  relevant  
commodities  or relevant  products  that  their  relevant  products  contain  or  that  are used  to  make  those  
products.   
  
This  means  that  operators need  to  collect  information  about  the  presence  of  the relevant  commodity  
within the relevant products that they are placing on the market or exporting. This information includes  
the geolocation of the plots of land where the relevant commodity contained in the relevant products,  
or  used  to  make  the  relevant  products  was  produced,  along  with  further  information  in  Article  9(1).  
Under Article 9, to meet the geolocation information requirements for their relevant products, operators  
shall include:   
      •    the  geolocation  of  all  plots  of  land  where  the  relevant  commodity  that  the  relevant  products  
           contain, or have been made using, were produced, and   
      •    the date or time range of production.    
   
Where a relevant product contains or has been made with a relevant commodity produced on different  
plots of land, the geolocation of all the different plots of land needs to be provided. For relevant products  
that consist of or have been made from cattle, according to Article 2(29) the geolocation requirement  
refers to all premises or structures associated with raising the cattle, encompassing the birthplace, farms  
where they were kept - in case of open-air farming, any environment or place, where livestock are kept  
on a temporary or permanent basis-, until the time of slaughtering.  

If there is any deforestation or forest degradation on any of the plots of land that are identified for any  
of the relevant products within a relevant product that is a ‘composite product’, then that product cannot  
be placed or made available on the market or exported (Article 9(1)(d)).   
   
In  addition,  Article  9  requires  the  common  name  and  full  scientific  name  of  all  species,  for relevant  
products that contain or have been made using wood. This provision refers to all relevant products that  
are  listed  under  commodity  ‘wood’  in  Annex  I.  It  may  in  some  cases  be  complex  to  identify  all  the  
species  within  each  relevant  component  for  highly  processed  composite  products,  such  as  particle  
boards,  paper  and  printed  books.  However,  if  the  species  of  e.g.  wood  used  to  produce  the  product  
varies,  the  operator  will  have  to  provide  a  list  of  each  species  of  wood  that  may  have  been  used  to  
produce  the  wood  product.  The  species  should  be  listed  in  accordance  with  internationally  accepted  
timber  nomenclature  (e.g.  DIN  EN  13556  of  1  October  2003  on  ‘Nomenclature  of  timbers  used  in  
Europe’).  
  
b)   Due diligence for composite products: using existing due diligence statements  
  
Operators who are placing on the market or exporting ‘composite products’ (for example furniture made  
from  other  relevant  timber  products)  can  make  reference  to  existing  due  diligence  statements  where  
applicable. When non-SME operators or non-SME traders are making a submission to the Information  
System  (described  in  Article  33)  they  can  refer  to  due  diligence  statements  that  have  already  been  
submitted  to  the  Information  System,  but  only  in  cases  where  they  have  ascertained  that  the  due  
diligence for the products contained in or made from relevant products has been properly exercised, in  
accordance with Article 4(1) and (9).  
  
Information contained in existing due diligence statements may be referred to in order to complete the  
information  to  be  contained  in  a  Due  Diligence  Statement  set  out  in  Annex  II.  For  example,  the  
geolocation information, scientific names may be identified in the due diligence statement of a relevant  
product contained in the relevant product that the operator is seeking to place on the market or export  
and will not have  to be provided  again  if reference  is made to the upstream  due  diligence  statement.  
Reference  can be made  in the  Information  System by  entering  the reference number  and verification  

                                                                    21

number  of  an  upstream  due  diligence  statement  when  a  new  statement  is  submitted.  Operators  and  
traders submitting due diligence statements will be able to decide whether the geolocation information  
contained  in  their  statements  submitted  in  the  Information  System  will  be  accessible  and  visible  for  
downstream operators via the referenced due diligence statements inside the Information System.    
Overall, the development and functioning of the Information System is in line with the applicable data  
protection provisions.  In  addition, the  system  is  equipped with  security  measures  that will  ensure  
the integrity and confidentiality of the information that the Information System contains17.  

  
According to Article 4(7) the  operators  -  including  SMEs  -  shall provide all information necessary to  
demonstrate compliance of the product, including the due diligence reference numbers to operators and  
traders further down the supply chain. According to Article 4(8) the SME operators are not required to  
exercise  due  diligence  for  relevant  products  contained  in  or  made  from  relevant  products  that  have  
already been subject to due diligence according to Article 4(1) and where a due diligence statement has  
already been  submitted  in  accordance with Article  33.  SME  operators need to provide the  competent  
authorities with the reference number of the due diligence statement upon the request of the competent  
authority.  SME  operators  do have to  exercise  due  diligence  and  submit  a  due  diligence  statement  for  
parts  of  relevant  products  that  have  not  already  been  subject  to  due  diligence  or  no  due  diligence  
statement was submitted in accordance with Article 4(8).  
  

  10.  THE ROLE OF CERTIFICATIONS AND THIRD-PARTY VERIFICATION SCHEMES  
                                 IN RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK MITIGATION  
  
Relevant legislation: EUDR – Recital (52); Article 10(2)(n) – Risk assessment   
  
Certification and third-party verified schemes are often used to meet specific customer requirements for  
relevant commodities and relevant products. This may include a  standard that describes practices that  
must  be  implemented  during  production  of  the  certified  commodities,  comprising  principles,  criteria  
and indicators; requirements for checking compliance with the standard and awarding certificates; and  
separate  chain-of-custody  certification  to  provide  assurance  along  the  supply  chain  that  a  product  
contains only (or in some cases a specified percentage of) certified or third-party verified material from  
identified and certified or third-party verified producers.  

The EUDR acknowledges that certification and other third-party verified schemes may provide useful  
information on compliance with the Regulation in the risk assessment further to Article 10 by supporting  
evidence  that  products  are  legal  and  deforestation-free.  This  is  subject  to  the  condition  that  this  
information meets the relevant requirements set out in Article 9, as stipulated in Article  10(2)(n).   

Indeed,  certifications  and  third-party  verified  schemes  are  operated  by  an  organisation  that  is  not  a  
participant in the production or the supply chain of the relevant commodity. Furthermore, some of these  
schemes are often used to verify that certain standards or rules are being followed, but do not necessarily  
go as far as certifying the product itself.   

This  guidance  is  directed  primarily  to  stakeholders  considering  making  use  of  certification  or  third- 
party verified schemes given their potential added value in providing complementary information, such  
as on geolocation coordinates and supporting the operators’ risk assessment undertaken as part of their  
due  diligence  exercise  that  relevant  products  are  legal  and  deforestation-free.  The  EUDR  does  not  
oblige:  (1) operators to make use of such  schemes,  (2) producers to  sign up to them, nor  (3) producer  
countries  to  develop  such  schemes.  Making  use  of  third-party  verification  schemes  is  not  a  legal  
requirement, but a voluntary decision of the operator. If operators decide to make use of these schemes,  

                                             
17 OJ L, 2024/3084, 6.12.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2024/3084/oj  

                                                                  22  
﻿  
  

this guidance is designed to help them assess the degree to which these schemes can support to meet the  
requirements of the EUDR.  

Certification  and  third-party  verified  schemes  can  play  an  important  role  in  promoting  sustainable  
agricultural and forestry practices and responsible sourcing, in fostering supply chain transparency and  
in  facilitating  compliance.  To  note  that  self-declaration  schemes  that  do  not  rely  on  third  party  
attestation procedures are outside of the scope of this guidance and are, by definition, less robust because  
of the lack of independence and impartiality.   

This guidance is also relevant for national competent authorities by underlining that while such schemes  
can  be  used  in  the  risk  assessment  procedure  under  Article  10,  they  cannot  substitute  the  operator’s  
responsibility  as regards  due  diligence  further to  Article  8.  This  means  that the use  of  such  schemes  
does not imply a “green lane”, since the operator is still required to exercise due diligence and is held  
liable if it fails to comply with the due diligence requirements of the EUDR.   

There is a great diversity of  schemes in terms of their scope, their objectives, their  structure and their  
operating methods. One important distinction is (1) whether or not they rely on a third-party attestation  
procedure, thereby  grouping them  into  certification  and third-party verified  schemes  on the  one hand  
and  (2)  self-declaration  schemes  on  the  other.  The  latter  are  outside  of  the  scope  of  this  guidance  
document and are, by definition, less robust because of the lack of independence and impartiality.  

a)   The role of certifications and third-party verification schemes  
  
In considering whether to make use of information supplied by a certification scheme or third-party  
verified  scheme  in  the  risk  assessment  procedure  under  Article  10  as  supporting  evidence  that  the  
product  is  legal  and  deforestation-free,  an  operator  should,  as  a  first  step,  determine  whether  the  
scheme’s standards are in accordance with relevant provisions of the EUDR. In this regard, it should be  
pointed  out  that  operators  may  also  use  third  party  verification  schemes  or  certification  schemes  for  
compliance with only certain requirements of the Regulation.   

Certification and third-party verification schemes generally require third-party organisations to be able  
to demonstrate their qualifications to perform assessments through a process of accreditation that sets  
standards for the skills of auditors and the systems that the certification organisations must adhere to.  
Certified or verified products generally carry a label with the certification or verification organisation’s  
name and type as well as the requirements for the auditing process. The scheme may also require that  
partners have this information included in the formal documents accompanying the shipment. These  
organisations will normally be able to provide information on coverage of the certification and how it  
was applied in the country of production of the relevant products, including details about the nature and  
frequency of field audits.   

Certification and third-party verification schemes can be assessed according to three main elements:  1)  
'the relevant standards’, i.e. operating requirement, scope, procedures, policies for companies adhering  
to  these  schemes,  2)  ‘the  implementation  by  the  schemes’,  i.e.  the  extent  to  which  the  standards  are  
implemented, including by deploying the necessary measures to ensure compliance also via audits and  
3)   ‘governance  features’/credibility  assessment  of  the  schemes  such  as  transparency,  assurance  
processes, oversight etc. Such information should be regularly reassessed by the operator, especially in  
relation to the requirements of the EUDR.  

Regarding  EUDR  requirements,  insofar  as  this  is  relevant  to  the  information  provided  by  the  
certification  or third-party verification  scheme,  for  example  operators  should  scrutinise the  following  
aspects of the certification or third-party verification schemes under  1) ‘the relevant standards’:  

     •    validity, authenticity, and inclusion within the scope of certification or third-party verification  
           of the association of the certificate for a relevant commodity or product,  

                                                                23  
﻿  
  

      •    inclusion  and  compliance  with  relevant  legal  requirements,  such  as  the  alignment  with  the  
           definition  of  deforestation-free  and  the  cut-off  date  of  31  December  2020,  as  stipulated  in  
           Articles 2 and 3 of the EUDR,  
      •    assessment   of  the  risk   of  non-compliance  regarding   legality  and  the   deforestation-free  
           requirements of the relevant product,  
      •    traceability of the relevant products, including via geolocation back to the plot of land,  
      •    possibility to mix known origin and unknown origin material within the chain of custody (CoC)  
           model (which is not acceptable under the EUDR)18. A relevant product with CoC certification  

           may  also  contain  a  mix  of  certified  and  non-certified  material  from  a  variety  of  sources,  for  
           which information about whether checks on the non-certified portion have been performed and  
           whether those checks provide adequate evidence of compliance with the EUDR requirements  
           must be  obtained.  The  due  diligence procedure  must therefore be  completed  for  the relevant  
           product in entirety.   
      •    possibility to use mass balance where compliant products are mixed with products of unknown  
           origin (which is not acceptable under the EUDR)19,  

      •    ability  of  the  scheme  to  provide  required  information  accompanied  by  evidence  that  is  
           “adequately conclusive and verifiable”, as set out in Article 9.   
  
Secondly, under 2) ‘the implementation by schemes’, operators should consider:  

      •    accessibility of information regarding the scheme governance, engagement of stakeholders with  
           the scheme, and summaries of audits,   
      •    free  and  publicly  accessible  database  about  certification  holders,  their  scope  of  coverage,  
           validity, date of suspending or terminating certification status and related audit reports,  
      •    transparent periodic, random and independent checks (including through audits) on compliance  
           of  the  certification  or  third-party  verification  scheme  with  their  own  standards,  rules  and  
           procedures,    
      •    control  of  quantity  and  origin  of  certified  materials  across  the  supply  chain,  including  for  
           example  use  of  anatomical,  chemical  or  DNA  analysis  to  verify  information  on  product  or  
           supply chain traceability,   
      •    effective controls for verification of volumes across supply chains20,  

      •    use of similar stamps/claims referring to different types of schemes,  
      •    existing  substantiated reports  about possible  shortcomings  or problems  of the  certification  or  
           third-party verified scheme concerned in the countries from which the relevant commodities or  
           products originate,  
      •    existing  substantiated reports  concerning  a  given producer  or trader using the  certification  or  
           third-party verified scheme concerned.   

                                             
18  Some  schemes  allow  certification  when  a  specified  percentage  of  the  relevant  product,  usually  stated  on  the  

label, has met the  full  certification  standard. In  such  cases, it  is  important that the  operator  obtains  information  
about  whether  checks  on  the  non-certified  portion  have  been  performed  and  whether  they  provide  adequate  
evidence  of  compliance with the  geolocation  and the  deforestation-free  element  for the non-certified portion  as  
well.  
19 Some  schemes  allow  certification  when  mass  balance  chains  of  custody  are  used.  Such  mixed  products  are,  

however, not  compliant with the EUDR.  Only products  fully  compliant with the  elements mentioned  above  are  
allowed  under  the  EUDR,  excluding  mixed  products  based  on  certain  percentages  or  mass  balance  chains  of  
custody.  
20 Chain-of-custody certification may be used as evidence that no unknown or non-permitted commodity enters a  

supply chain. These are generally based on ensuring that only permitted commodities and products are allowed to  
enter the supply chain at  ‘critical control points’, and a product can be traced to its previous custodian (who must  
also hold chain-of-custody certification) rather than back to the place of origin. A product with chain-of-custody  
certification may  contain  a mix  of  certified  and other permitted material  from  a variety  of  sources. When using  
chain-of-custody  certification,  an  operator  should  ensure that  all materials  comply with the requirements  of the  
EUDR and that controls are sufficient to exclude non-compliant material.  

                                                                  24  
﻿  
  

   
Under 3)  ‘on the governance of schemes’, operators should consider the following elements:   
     •     potential conflicts of interests,  
     •     extent and findings of controls on fraud and corruption,  
     •     compliance of the certification or third-party verification scheme with international or European  
           standards (e.g., the relevant ISO-guides),  
     •     consequences and sanctioning in case of infractions as well as corrective actions, also in terms  
           of suspension of certification until corrective measures are taking place, taking also into account  
           the speed of procedure to revoke and restore authorization to issue certification for products,   
     •     inclusion  of  provisions  about  stakeholder  engagement,  also  enabling  and  promoting  the  
           participation of smallholders (if relevant) in the scheme.  
     •     information  about  the  independence  of  third-party  organisations  that  deliver  the  relevant  
           certification or verification services as accredited organisations. Assurances or representations  
           from the  scheme,  scheme-affiliated auditors or third-party auditors engaged by the  scheme to  
           perform its assurance procedures should not be relied upon in isolation or taken as conclusive.  
           The  views  of  other  relevant  stakeholders,  including  scheme  participants,  labour  unions,  
           workers’ and smallholders’ associations, civil society and non-governmental organisations, and  
           third-party  auditing  and  assurance  organisations,  should be  considered  if they  are reasonably  
           available.  
       
b)   Background information  
  
Certification  and  third-party  verified  schemes  are  either  public  or  private,  depending  on  their  
governance model, whether government-run or not. They can be mandatory or voluntary, depending on  
whether they are legally-binding. Private schemes are voluntarily used by the operator, while public  
ones are often (though not necessarily) mandatory and established by the countries from which products  
are sourced. Both public and private certification and third-party verification schemes aim to recognise  
good environmental standards through certification, and as such many of them have made important  
contributions to raising the sustainability of agricultural production worldwide.    

Nonetheless,  the  impact  assessment  preceding  the  EUDR,  building  on  other  relevant  studies,  also  
identified a number of concerns regarding such schemes, including that  they have varying levels of  
transparency and different rules, procedures, and quality assurance systems in place, as well as related  
to monitoring, disclosure and enforcement. Over the years of their operation, concerns have also been  
raised over the efficiency and integrity of chain-of-custody (CoC) systems and their vulnerability to  
fraud. In addition, the lack of independent audits is a weakness of certain private schemes. A specific  
study commissioned by the Commission on Certification and Verification Schemes in the Forest Sector  
and for Wood-based Products made similar findings, pointing to a lack of transparency and the risk of  
partial or even misleading information21 .  

Mandatory public verification schemes with binding measures can include high standards, both in terms  
of coverage and implementation. It is key that they cover all economic operators in a country (including  
both placing on the market and exports) to avoid loopholes and leakage that may be caused by presence  
of economic operators not covered by the scheme. They can also ensure better smallholder integration  
by providing the necessary support to overcome the problem of costs, often perceived as significant, as  
economies of scale have SMEs at a disadvantage in achieving certification in comparison to larger  
operators and traders.

﻿  
  

As regards reliability and relevance of both private and public schemes, all applicable elements of their  
standards  should  be  in  line  with  (either  at  the  same  level,  or  higher  than)  the  EUDR,  in  particular  
regarding the deforestation-free definition, geolocation requirements and transparency and the legality  
of production.  

In this context it is important to note that not all schemes include standards and assessments relating to  
the legality of production of the relevant commodity, and it may therefore be relevant to check what  
legality requirements are covered by the schemes, both in terms of the laws they cover, and the criteria  
or indicators relied on to assess compliance. For example, schemes may differ in their definitions of  
what is to be considered a relevant “law” or “legal” in the country of production or the indicators that  
must be considered to assess the risks of illegality.   

Internal decision-making and governance, including the direct participation of supply chain actors that  
seek and hold certification or acquire and use certified products to meet customer demands, are also  
elements which have implications for the implementation, enforcement and credibility of any relevant  
scheme.  

To  further  facilitate  trade  and  compliance with the  EUDR,  a repository  of practices will be  set up to  
which  economic  operators  may  refer  when  carrying  out  their  due  diligence  for  placing  and  making  
available products on the EU market, and competent authorities when performing the relevant checks.  
  
To consider further relevant elements of all forms of certification and third-party verification, consult  
the  Commission’s  Impact  Assessment22 ,  the  EU  best  practice  guidelines  for  voluntary  certification  
schemes  for  agricultural  products  and  foodstuffs23,  and  the  findings  of  the  Commission’s  Study  on  
Certification and Verification Schemes in the Forest Sector and for Wood-based Products24 .  

  

                                                 11.  AGRICULTURAL USE  
  
1.   Introduction  

Article 3(a) of the EUDR prohibits placing and making available on or exporting from the Union market  
relevant commodities and relevant products unless they are deforestation-free. Article 2(13)(a) defines  
‘deforestation-free’  as  the  relevant  products  containing,  having  been  fed  with,  or  having  been  made  
using relevant commodities that were produced on land that has not been subject to deforestation after  
31  December  202025 .  According  to  Article  2(3)  ‘deforestation’  means  the  conversion  of  forest  to  

agricultural use, whether human-induced or not.  
  
Recital  (36)  of the EUDR explains that the  Commission  should  develop guidelines in order to  clarify  
the interpretation of the definition  ‘agricultural use’, in particular in relation to the conversion of forest  
to land, the purpose of which is not agricultural use. Recital 31 of the Regulation on Nature Restoration26  

also refers to such guidelines.  
  
 The main objectives of this Chapter are therefore the following:

25 The other element of ‘deforestation-free’ in Article 2(13)(b), which stipulates that relevant products containing  

or having been made using wood have been harvested without inducing forest degradation is outside the scope of  
this chapter which deals specifically with the definition of agricultural use.

      •    to  clarify  the  definition  of  forest,  measurement  of  the  technical  parameters  used  to  define  
           ‘forest’ under the EUDR in terms of area, average height and canopy cover, particularly in cases  
           where trees are bordering or overlapping with agricultural areas (Section 3);  
      •    to clarify the meaning of  ‘set aside agricultural areas’ and  ‘agricultural plantations’ referred to  
           in Article 2(5) of the EUDR, in particular the conditions under which agricultural areas, which  
           have  been  e.g.  set-aside,  or  are  lying  fallow  or  are  used  for  certain  nurseries  remain  under  
           ‘agricultural use’ for the purposes of Article 2 irrespective of the land characteristics, in order  
           and to clarify the conditions for conversion of forest to agricultural area (Sections 3 and 4);  
      •    to provide guidance about the circumstances, in which in spite of an observed tree cover after  
           31 December 2020 (the cut-off date laid down in Article 2(13) of the EUDR), the area should  
           be considered under  ‘agricultural use’ (Section 4);   
      •    to  clarify  situations  where  an  area  falling  under  the  definition  of  ‘forest’  should  not  be  
           considered as converted to “agricultural use” but to other land uses, in particular:   
                ▪     to  other  land  use  to  prevent,  minimise,  mitigate  or  reverse  the  adverse  impact  on  
                     biodiversity of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species, or   
                ▪     to semi-natural habitats that are extensively managed (e.g. by conservation grazing) as  
                     required by a conservation or restoration plan implementing obligations stemming from  
                      international conventions on nature and biodiversity protection and restoration, or  
                ▪     for forest fire prevention or for deployment of renewable energy (Sections 2 and 4.a);  
      •    to provide interpretation of “agricultural use” under the EUDR, taking into account definitions  
           laid down in applicable EU legislations and explanatory notes that are agreed on international  
           level (Sections 4, 4.c and 4.d);  
      •    to  clarify  the  combined  and  synergetic  uses  of  areas  with  tree  cover  that  fall  under  the  
           definitions      in   the    EUDR,       such     as   agroforestry,       agrosilvicultural,       silvopastoral      and  
           agrosilvopastoral systems (Section 4.d);  
      •    to  clarify  different  land  use  types  in  the  same  area  and  the  use  of  cadastral  maps  and  land  
           registers (Section 5).  
  
2.   Clarification of conversion of forest to land the purpose of which is not agricultural use   

  Relevant  legislation: EUDR – Recital  (36), Article 2  (3),  (5),  (13) – Definitions, Article  3  (a) –  
  Prohibition  
  
According to Article 2(3) of EUDR  ‘deforestation’ means conversion of forest to agricultural use and  
should be understood as a change in the use of the land from ‘forest’ as defined in Article 2(4) of EUDR  
(discussed in detail in Section 3) to  ‘agricultural use’ as defined in Article 2(5) of EUDR (discussed in  
detail  in  Sections  4,  4.c  and  4.d).  In  this  regard,  the  extent  of  the  conversion  to  agricultural  use  is  
irrelevant, and such conversion renders the commodity in scope produced on such land non-compliant  
if the deforestation occurred after 31 December 2020.   
The  classification  of an  area  as  ‘deforested’ is based  on the  objective criterion whether the  forest has  
been converted for a specific use and purpose, which is independent from the legally registered use and  
geographical boundaries of the plot of land or from the question of who or what is at the origin of the  
deforestation.  
  
For the purpose of this Regulation, conversion of forest into other land uses which do not fall under the  
definition  of  ‘agricultural  use’  means  that  this  conversion  does  not  fall  under  the  definition  of  
‘deforestation’  (please  see  detailed  information  about  ‘Agricultural  use’  in  Section  4).  This  includes  
conversion  of  forest  into  areas  of  urban  infrastructure  such  as  electricity  lines,  roads,  cities  and  
settlements, for non-agricultural industrial sites, or for renewable energy deployment.   
  
Conversion of forest land also does not fall under the EUDR definition of ‘deforestation’ if the primary  
purpose of the conversion and its subsequent land use is not agricultural use, but e.g. renewable energy  

                                                                  27

deployment, industrial use, restoration of biodiversity, forest fire prevention, animal welfare in extreme  
climatic conditions, or management of invasive alien species. Ancillary agricultural activities may take  
place  where  essential  to  support  the  primary  purpose  of  conversion  and  of  the  land  use  after  the  
conversion (see section 4.a), or where the agricultural activity does not change the predominant use of  
forest (see section 4.b).   
  
The responsibility for the enforcement of the provisions lies with the Member  States. When applying  
these guidelines to individual cases, the Member States should ensure that the specific circumstances of  
each case are duly taken into account, considering also the relevant provisions of the Treaty. In cases  
where  the  activities  are  negligible,  given  all  circumstances  at  stake,  the  principle  of  proportionality  
should be respected.   
  
3.   Definition of ‘Forest’  

  Relevant legislation  : EUDR – Article 2(4) – Definitions  
  
According to Article 2  (4) of the EUDR  an  area is  considered  ‘forest’  if the  following  characteristics  
apply:  
    •      Land  spanning more than 0.5 hectares – This means that the area of trees described by the  
           perimeter of canopy cover reaches 0.5 hectare or beyond.   
    •      Trees higher than 5 metres – this means that the top of the trees reaches the average height of  
           5 metres or more.  
    •      Canopy cover of more than  10% - This means that the ratio of the canopy cover of the trees  
           forming the tree stand to the area occupied by the tree stand is more than  10%.   
    •      Trees  able  to  reach  those  thresholds in  situ –  This means  areas with young trees that have  
           not yet reached but expected to reach canopy cover  10% and tree height of 5 metres. It includes  
           in  particular  areas  that  are  temporarily  unstocked  due  to  clear-cutting  as  part  of  a  forest  
           management practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated.   
    •      Excluding land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use – This means  
           that the forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant  
           land use (see below and also Section 4).   

The land spanning, the average height, and the canopy cover characteristics must be present  or able to  
reach these thresholds in-situ simultaneously.  
   
In the  context of EUDR,  ‘urban land  use’  should be  considered predominant for  example in case  of  
parks and gardens in urban areas, irrespective of reaching the thresholds of forest definition. For more  
information about predominant ‘agricultural use’ see Section 4.  
Provided that the characteristics in the definition are met, the area of ‘forest’ includes but is not limited  
to:  
     •     areas surrounded by forests or strictly connected to it used for forestry, such as forest roads, fire  
           breaks,  and  other  small  open  areas,  unless  they  are  established  on  their  own  individual  real- 
           estate property,  
     •     land abandoned generally for more than  10 years with a regeneration of trees that have reached  
           the criteria of  ‘forest’ (please see in connection with  ‘set-aside land and land under temporary  
           fallow’ in Section 4);  
     •     mangroves in tidal zones, regardless of whether this area is classified as land area or not;  
     •     nurseries of forest species grown within forest area to fulfil the forest owners’ own needs;   
     •     areas  outside  the  legally  designated  forest  land  which  meet  the  criteria  of  the  definition  of  
           ‘forest’.  

The   definition   of   ‘forest’   excludes  tree   stands   in   agricultural  production   systems.  For   further  
information, please see Sections 4.c and 4.d.  

                                                                  28

4.   Definition of ‘Agricultural use’ and exceptions  

  
  Relevant legislation: EUDR – Article 2 (5) – Definitions   
  
According to Article 2 (5) of the EUDR an area is considered under ‘agricultural use’ if the purpose of  
the land use is agriculture.  
  
a)   Clarification of the purpose of agriculture  

According to Article 2(5) the land is  used for the purposes  of  agriculture  (among  others) in the  
following list of cases:  
     •     agricultural plantations defined in Article 2(6) of the EUDR. For a more detailed guidance on  
           ‘agricultural plantations’, please see Section 4.c.  
     •     set-aside agricultural areas – Set-aside agricultural areas should be considered in combination  
          with ‘land under temporary fallow’ as discussed below in this section.   
     •     rearing  of  livestock  –  This  includes  areas  of  temporary  or  permanent  pastures,  and  farm  
          buildings for rearing and housing animals.  

It should be noted that the categories of  ‘agricultural plantation’,  ‘set-aside agricultural area’, and area  
‘for rearing livestock’ are a non-exhaustive list of examples for ‘agricultural use’.   
  
For  the  purpose  of  this  Regulation,  land  used  for  agriculture  should  be  understood  as  covering  the  
following land use categories:   
     •     Land under temporary crops which means all land used for crops with a usually less than one- 
           year growing cycle, including multi-annual temporary crops.  
     •     Land  under  temporary  meadows  and  pastures  which  means  land  cultivated  with  herbaceous  
           forage crops, or grasses for mowing or pasture for a period of less than five years in a row.  
     •     Set-aside land, or land under temporary fallow which means agricultural land at prolonged rest  
           before re-cultivation, pastoral use  or use  for  other  agricultural  activities.  This may be part  of  
           the  agricultural  holdings’  crop  rotation  system  or  because  legitimate  reasons  or  exceptional  
           circumstances  such  as  flood  damage,  lack  of  water,  unavailability  of  inputs,  including  
           economic, social (illness, succession problems) or legal reasons (litigation, etc). NB: Land set- 
           aside or remaining fallow should be considered as remaining under ‘agricultural use’ generally  
           for  [ten] years. However, the area can be considered as remaining under  ‘agricultural use’ for  
           longer than this period if it is demonstrated that the agricultural activities could not be resumed  
           because of one of the above-mentioned reasons. The reason given must cover the whole period  
           in which the land was set-aside or under temporary fallow. If such demonstration is made, the  
           land  should  be  continuously  considered  to  be  under  agricultural  use,  unless  it  is  officially  
           designated as forest by national law.   
     •     Land under permanent crops which means land cultivated with long-term crops which do not  
           have to be replanted  for  several years, usually  for  five years  or more.  Land under permanent  
           crops  also  includes  land  used  for  growing  permanent  crops  under  protective  cover,  which  is  
           described in Section 4.b.   
     •     Land under permanent meadows and pastures which means land used for more than five years  
           in a row for grazing animals or to grow forage crops, through cultivation or naturally.  
     •     Land under  farm buildings  and  farmyards which means  surfaces  occupied by  operating  farm  
           buildings  (hangars, barns, cellars,  silos), buildings  for  animal production  (stables,  cow  sheds,  
           sheep pens, poultry yards) and farmyards.   
     •     Where it can be demonstrated by adequately conclusive evidence that both (i) a plot of land was  
           under ‘agricultural use’ as described above before 31 December 2020, and (ii) where a producer  

                                                                 29  
﻿  
  

           decided  to  plant  short rotation  coppice  or  commit  the  land  to  temporary  afforestation  before  
           that date or after that date and that land does not fall under the  scope of a forest management  
           plan or legislation requiring forest management or protection of forest on that plot of land, such  
           plot  of  land  is  deemed  to  remain  in  agricultural  use  for  the  purposes  of  the  EUDR  and  the  
           producer may continue agricultural activity on that plot of land.  
     •     The  above-mentioned  agricultural  land  use  categories  can  cover  also  surfaces  occupied  by  
           landscape elements, which are encouraged for biodiversity or environmental reasons.  

Restoration,  management  of  invasive  species,  forest  fire  prevention,  animal  welfare,  renewable  
energy deployment    
  
Land which has undergone conversion for one or  several of the primary purposes listed below  should  
not be understood as converted to agricultural use if the conversion has been undertaken to:  
     -     prevent, minimise, mitigate or reverse the adverse impact on biodiversity of the introduction  
           and spread of invasive alien species, if limited to what is strictly necessary and  supported by  
           prevention plans, management plans, or official mandates, or  
     -     prevent, or minimise and mitigate the risk of forest fires, if limited to what is strictly necessary  
           and supported by fire prevention plans, forest management plans, or official mandates, or  
     -     ensure compliance with animal welfare laws where the erection of structures (permanent and  
           non-permanent) to house animals is necessary for the purpose of ensuring their welfare and  
           limited to the minimum necessary area for the construction, and where this activity does not  
           impact on the categorisation of the surrounding areas as forest, or  
     -     ensure  the  restoration  and  subsequent  conservation  management  of  ecosystems  of  high  
           biodiversity value (such as for example certain types of heathlands, wetland or grassland) if  
           required by a conservation or restoration plan (for example a management plan of a protected  
           area or a national or regional nature restoration plan) implementing obligations stemming from  
           global multilateral agreements on nature and biodiversity protection and restoration such as the  
           Convention       on    Biological      Diversity     and    the    Kunming-Montreal           Global     Biodiversity  
           Framework, or  
     -     deploy renewable energy (e.g. through establishment of wind farms, photovoltaics),  
  
even if ancillary agricultural activities may take place where essential to support the primary purpose  
of conversion and the land use after the conversion.   
             
b)   Clarification of the predominant land use  
             
According  to  Article  2(4),  in  case the predominant  land use  is  agriculture then  the  land  does not  fall  
under the ‘forest’ definition.  

In the context of EUDR, for the purposes of the exclusions referred to in the definition of  ‘forest’ in  
Article 2(4), ‘agricultural use’ should be considered predominant in the following non-exhaustive list  
of cases:  

     •     Seasonal (e.g. summer grazing) or temporary silvopastoral grazing in tree covered areas which  
           do  not  fall  into  the  category  of  primary  forests  (e.g.  in  semi-natural  pastures  or  in  natural  
           pastures with changing tree cover).   
     •     If  due  to  climatic  conditions  (e.g.  temporary  snow  cover)  silvopastoral  or  agrisilvicultural  
           practices are limited to a certain period of the year, they can be considered the predominant use.   
     •      Establishing protective groups of trees for various environmental or biodiversity purposes on  
           a predominantly agricultural use (e.g. grazing) area, even if the area reaches the thresholds of  
           the ‘forest’ definition.  

                                                                 30  
﻿  
  

These  cases  are  different  from  ancillary  agricultural  activities  in  the  context  of  conversion  for  the  
purpose of restoration or management of invasive alien species, which do not fall under “agricultural  
use”, see above.   
  
In contrast, for the purposes of EUDR,  ‘agricultural use’ should not be considered predominant for  
example  in case of small-scale production of side products (e.g. coffee), and occasional  extensive  or  
occasionally small-scale grazing in forests as long as the production and related activities do not have  
detrimental effect on the habitat of the forest.  
  
c)    Definition of ‘Agricultural plantation’  

  Relevant legislation: EUDR – Article 2(6) – Definitions  
  
‘Agricultural  plantations’  are  included  in  the  definition  of  ‘agricultural  use’  set  out  in  Article  2(5)  
EUDR.  
  
The  definition  of  Article  2(6)  of  the  EUDR  “agricultural  plantation’  refers  firstly  to  ‘land  with  tree  
stands  in  agricultural  production  systems,  such  as  fruit  tree  plantations,  oil  palm  plantations,  olive  
orchards” which makes reference to cropland including permanent crops as described in Section 4.   
  
Secondly, that definition refers to “agroforestry systems where crops are grown under tree cover”, which  
is explained in  Section 4.d and must be read together with the exception where predominant land use  
does not change. Article 2 (6) EUDR further clarifies that all plantations of relevant commodities other  
than wood  are  encompassed under  the  terms  ‘agricultural plantation’,  therefore  these plantations  fall  
under the definition of  ‘agricultural use’.  
  
Finally, Article 2 (6) EUDR lays down that agricultural plantations are excluded from the definition of  
‘forest’. This means that the areas fulfilling the criteria of agricultural plantation do not fall under the  
definition of forest, even where they include trees such as rubber or oil palm.  
  
d)   Clarification of ‘Agroforestry system’  

  Relevant legislation: EUDR – Recital (37) and Article 2 (6) – Definitions  
  
According  to  FAO  documents 27   ‘agroforestry’  is  a  collective  name  for  land  use   systems  and  
technologies where woody perennials (trees, shrubs, palms, bamboos, etc) are deliberately used on the  
same land management unit as agricultural crops and/or animals, in some form of spatial arrangement  
or  temporal  sequence.  In  agroforestry  systems  there  are  both  ecological  and  economic  interactions  
between  the  different  components.  There  are  two  basic  agroforestry  systems:  simultaneous  and  
sequential.  Simultaneous systems have trees and crops or animals growing together on the same piece  
of  land, while  in  sequential  systems  crops  and trees take turns  in  occupying most  of the  same  space,  
minimising their competition.  
  
Agroforestry can also refer to specific forestry practices that complement agricultural activities, such as  
by improving soil fertility, reducing soil erosion, improving watershed management, or providing shade  
and food for livestock28 .  
  
Recital (37) recalls that FAO definitions do not consider agroforestry systems as forests, but agricultural  
use and that they encompass various situations such as those where crops are grown under tree cover,  
as well as agrisilvicultural, silvopastoral and agrosilvopastoral systems.

﻿  
  

  
Since the definition of  ‘forest’ in Article 2(4) of the EUDR excludes land that is predominantly under  
‘agricultural use’, it can be  inferred that  if  a  land is predominantly used under  ‘agroforestry  systems’  
for the purposes spelled out by Recital (37), it cannot be considered as  ‘forest’. In this case and for the  
purpose  of the Regulation, this  land must be  considered  as being under  ‘agricultural use’. Regarding  
ancillary agricultural activities, including agroforestry activities in the context of restoration please see  
Section 2.  
  
5.    Clarification of land use in case of multiple land use types in the same area and the use of  
      land registries and cadastral maps  

In case a plot of land contains both an area falling under the definition of  ‘forest’ and an area which is  
‘agricultural use’, the two  areas  are to be  considered  separately.  The  area  fulfilling the  criteria  of the  
definition  of  ‘forest’  falls  under  the  scope  of  the  Regulation,  while  the  area  fulfilling  the  criteria  of  
‘agricultural use’, does not fall under the scope of the Regulation in terms of conversion.   
  
Whether  the  part  of  the  plot  of  land  used  for  agriculture  is  bigger  than  the  part  of  the  plot  of  land  
considered a forest under the definition, is not relevant. As an example, this means that if a  10-hectare  
property has a 2-hectare area that can be considered as forest area by objective criteria and  8 hectares  
are cultivated under agricultural use, then the 2 hectares of forest are classified as forest, regardless of  
the fact that it only makes up 20% of the total property.  
  
In the assessment of whether a certain plot of land constitutes forest, the actual forest properties should  
prevail over the designation in land registers and cadastral maps. For demonstrating agricultural use in  
the  past,  land  registers  and  cadastral  maps  can  be  further  elements  to  complement  the  satellite  data.  
Furthermore,  forest  management  plans  and  registers  of  designated  forest  areas  can  be  of  use  when  
determining whether the  area  is  a  forest without  current tree  cover, particularly  in  case  of the  area  is  
temporary unstocked without tree cover due to forest management practice, natural disaster, or the first  
years  of afforestation.  The EU  Observatory29 provided by the  Commission is  a free to use tool for  all  
stakeholders to determine the global forest cover of 2020. However, the Observatory is non-exclusive,  
non-mandatory and carries no legal value. Public and private stakeholders can use any maps that they  
see fit for the purpose of their due diligence exercise or checks.

HOW   DO   THE   INTERPRETATIONS   OF   ‘PLACING   ON   THE   MARKET’,   ‘MAKING  
AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET’ AND ‘EXPORT’ APPLY IN PRACTICE?   
   
The following scenarios outline situations in which a natural or legal person is considered an operator  
under the EUDR.   
   
[Unless  otherwise  specified,  operators  in  all  scenarios  below  are  responsible for   carrying  out  due  
diligence on the relevant products/commodities  and submitting a due diligence statement (DDS) to the  
EUDR Information System or assigning an authorised representative, referred  to Article  6,  to submit  
 the DDS on their behalf.]   
   
[According to Article 4(3) the submission of a due diligence statement (DDS) implies that the operator  
or non-SME trader has complied with the obligations as laid down in the applicable provisions  of the  
EUDR  and  assumes  responsibility for   the  conclusion  that  they  are  deforestation-free   and  have  been  
produced  in accordance with the relevant legislation of the country of production , according to Article  
3).   
   
   
 Scenario 1 – Processing of products  
   
EU-established manufacturer A  (non-SME  operator)  is  a  company that buys palm  oil  [HS  1511] in  a  
third country and imports it into the EU, where it uses the palm oil to produce industrial fatty alcohols  
 [HS 3823 70]. It then sells the industrial fatty alcohols to manufacturer B in another EU Member State.    
  
 ► Manufacturer  A  is  an  operator  when  importing  into  the  EU  (declare  for  the  customs  procedure  
 ‘release for free circulation’) the palm oil, as palm oil is a relevant product covered by Annex I of the  
EUDR. This means that manufacturer A must exercise due diligence on the palm oil, submit a DDS to  
the Information  System and include the DDS reference number in the customs declaration for release  
 for free circulation.   
 ► Manufacturer  A  is  also  an  operator  when  placing  the  industrial  fatty  alcohols  on  the  market,  as  
industrial  fatty  alcohols  are  relevant  products  covered  by  Annex  I  of  the  EUDR.  This  means  that  
manufacturer A must submit a separate DDS for the industrial fatty alcohols before placing them on the  
market, in which they may refer to their previous DDS reference number according to Article 4(9).   
   
 Scenario 2 – Packaging materials  
  
 Scenario 2a   
   
EU-established manufacturer C (SME operator) imports coated craft paper [HS 4810] from producer B  
 established  in  a third  country  and uses  it to package  other products that  are  subsequently  sold  on the  
Union market.   
  
 ► Manufacturer C is an operator when importing into the EU (i.e., declare for the customs procedure  
 ‘release for free circulation’) the craft paper, as craft paper is a relevant product covered by Annex I of  
the  EUDR:  although  it will be used  as packaging, the  craft paper  is  imported  as  a product  in  its  own  
right (compare with Scenario 2b) and therefore is subject to due diligence. Manufacturer C must submit  
 a DDS to the Information System and include the DDS reference number in the customs declaration for  
release for free circulation.  
 ► Manufacturer C is not required to exercise due diligence or submit a DDS for the craft paper when  
 subsequently used for packaging other products as it is not sold as a product in its own right but rather  
 as packaging material (which is of a kind normally used for packaging such goods, and not giving the  
product its essential character) and is therefore not regulated as a relevant product under the EUDR.   

                                                                      33  
﻿  
  

   
 Scenario 2b   
   
EU-established  company  D  (SME  operator)  imports  wooden  frames  [HS  4414]  from  a  third  country  
and sells them to EU-established retailer E. The frames were packaged in cardboard.    
  
 ►  Company  D  is  an  operator  when  importing  into  the  EU  (i.e.  declare  for  the  customs  procedure  
 ‘release for free circulation’) the wooden frames, as wooden frames are a relevant product covered by  
Annex I of the EUDR. This means that company D must exercise due diligence on the wooden frames,  
 submit  a  DDS  to  the  Information  System  and  include  the  DDS  reference  number  in  the  customs  
declaration for release for free circulation.  
 ► Company D is not required to exercise due diligence or submit a DDS for the cardboard packaging,  
as this was not  imported  as  a product  in its  own right but rather  as packaging material  (which  is  of  a  
kind normally used for packaging such goods, and not giving the product its essential character) and is  
therefore not regulated as a relevant product under the EUDR.   
  
 Scenario 3 – Transfers of ownership  
  
 Scenario 3a   
   
EU-established manufacturer F (non-SME operator) buys raw hides of cattle [HS ex 4101] from supplier  
H,  who  is  established  outside  the  EU.  Under  the  contract,  ownership  is  immediately  transferred  to  
manufacturer F while the hides are still outside the EU and manufacturer F imports them into the EU.  
After the import in the EU, manufacturer F processes the hides into tanned hides [HS ex 4104] and sells  
them to EU-established non-SME retailer I (trader).   
  
 ► Manufacturer  F  is  an  operator  when  importing  into  the  EU  (declare  for  the  customs  procedure  
 ‘release for free circulation’) raw hides of cattle, as raw hides of cattle are a relevant product covered  
by Annex I of the EUDR. This means that manufacturer F must exercise due diligence on the raw hides,  
 submit  a  DDS  to  the  Information  System  and  include  the  DDS  reference  number  in  the  customs  
declaration for release for free circulation. As part of their due diligence for the raw hides, manufacturer  
F must include geolocation information referring to all the establishments where the cattle were raised  
 (in accordance with Article 9(1)(d)). In accordance with recital (39), manufacturer F determines whether  
the cattle used to produce those hides were fed with another relevant product, and if so, conducts also  
the required due diligence for the livestock feed.   
 ► Manufacturer F is also an operator when placing the tanned hides on the market, as the tanned hides  
are relevant products covered by Annex I of the EUDR. This means that manufacturer F must submit a  
 separate DDS for them before  selling them to trader I. Manufacturer F may refer to the existing DDS  
relating to the raw hides it previously placed on the market upon import into the EU.    
 ► As  a  non-SME  trader,  trader  I  assumes  the  same  due  diligence  obligations  as  an  operator.  After  
having ascertained that due diligence relating to the raw hides of cattle was exercised, trader I is required  
to  submit  a  separate  DDS  for  the  tanned  hides  bought  from  manufacturer  F  before  selling  them  to  
consumers  or  other  actors  further  down  the  supply  chain  (i.e.,  making  them  available  on  the  Union  
market). Trader I’s DDS may reference manufacturer F’s existing DDS for the tanned hides according  
to Article 4(9).   
   
[In  this  scenario,  ownership  is  transferred from   a  non-EU  person   to  an  EU  person   before  the  
product  physically  enters the EU]    
   
 Scenario 3b   
   
An EU-established manufacturer F (non-SME operator) buys tanned hides of cattle [HS ex 4104] online  
 from supplier H, who is established outside the EU. Under the contract, ownership is only transferred  
to manufacturer F when the hides are delivered to their factory in the EU. Shipping agent G imports the  
hides into the EU on behalf of supplier H and delivers them to manufacturer F’s factory.    

                                                                     34  
﻿  
  

  
 ► Supplier H is an operator when importing the tanned hides of cattle into the EU (i.e., declare for the  
customs procedure  ‘release for free circulation’), as they are a relevant product covered by Annex I of  
the EUDR. This means that supplier H must exercise due diligence on the hides of cattle, submit a DDS  
to the Information System and include the DDS reference number in the customs declaration for release  
 for free circulation [or mandate shipping agent G as authorised representative according to Article 6(1)  
to  submit  it].  As  part  of  their  due  diligence  for  the  hides,  supplier  H  must  include  geolocation  
information referring to all the establishments where the cattle were raised (in accordance with Article  
 9(1)(d)). In accordance with recital (39), supplier H determines whether the cattle used to produce those  
hides were fed with another relevant product, and if so, conducts also the required due diligence for the  
livestock feed.   
  ► Manufacturer F is the first natural or legal person to make the relevant products available on the EU  
market  and  is  also  deemed  to  be  an  operator  pursuant  to  Article  7,  i.e.  although  it  is  actually  not  an  
operator pursuant to the definition laid down in Article 2(15), Article 7 establishes that it is subject to  
the same obligations as an operator. Therefore, manufacturer F must exercise due diligence and submit  
a separate DDS to the Information System before selling them to consumers or other actors further down  
the supply chain, in which it may refer to the DDS of supplier H according to Article 4(9).   
  
[In  this scenario,  ownership  is  only  transferred from   the  non-EU person   to  the EU person   after  the  
product  has physically  entered the EU]    
   
 Scenario 4 – Placing vs. making available on the market  
  
[Scenarios 4a, 4b, 4c and 4d demonstrate the difference between placing  and making available on the  
 Union market and exemplify some of the circumstances under which a downstream business may be an  
operator.]   
  
 Scenario 4a   
   
EU-established  wholesaler  J  (SME  operator)  imports  cocoa  powder  [HS  1805]  from  a  third  country  
 (non-EU)  producer  and  sells  it  to  EU-established  non-SME  retailer  K.  Retailer  K  imports  additional  
cocoa powder from a third country (non-EU producer) and mixes it with the cocoa powder purchased  
 from wholesaler J for sale to end consumers within the EU (compare with Scenarios 4b, 4c, 4d) .   
 ►  Wholesaler  J  is  an  operator  when  importing  into  the  EU  (i.e.,  declare  for  the  customs  procedure  
 ‘release for free circulation’) the cocoa powder (placing on the market), as cocoa powder is a relevant  
product covered by Annex I of the EUDR. This means that wholesaler J must exercise due diligence on  
the cocoa powder, submit a DDS to the Information System and include the DDS reference number in  
the customs declaration for release for free circulation.   
 ► For the cocoa powder bought from wholesaler J, retailer K is acting as a trader because this cocoa  
powder has already been placed on the Union market. As a non-SME trader, retailer K assumes the same  
due diligence obligations as an operator and is required to submit a DDS for the cocoa powder bought  
 from wholesaler J prior to selling it (making it available). Retailer K can refer to wholesaler J’s existing  
DDS  for  the  cocoa  powder,  after  ascertaining  that  due  diligence  has  been  undertaken  properly  in  
accordance  with  the  EUDR  requirements  according  to  Article  4(9),  but  retailer  K  still  retains  
responsibility for compliance.   
 ► Retailer K is an operator for the additional cocoa powder that K imports directly into the EU (declare  
 for the customs procedure  ‘release for free circulation’), as cocoa powder is a relevant product covered  
by Annex I of the EUDR and K is placing the additional cocoa powder on the market for the first time.  
This means that retailer K must exercise due diligence on the additional cocoa powder, submit a DDS  
to the Information System and include the DDS reference number in the customs declaration for release  
 for free circulation.    
   
 Scenario 4b   
   

                                                                     35  
﻿  
  

EU-established  wholesaler  J  (SME  operator)  imports  cocoa  powder  [HS  1805]  from  a  third  country  
 (non-EU)  producer  and  sells  it  to  EU-established  retailer  K  (non-SME  trader).  Retailer  K resells  the  
cocoa powder within the EU.   
 ►  Wholesaler  J  is  an  operator  when  importing  the  cocoa  powder  into  the  EU  (i.e.,  declare  for  the  
customs  procedure  ‘release  for  free  circulation’),  as  cocoa  powder  is  a  relevant  product  covered  by  
Annex I of the EUDR. This means that wholesaler J must exercise due diligence on the cocoa powder,  
 submit  a  DDS  to  the  Information  System  and  include  the  DDS  reference  number  in  the  customs  
declaration for release for free circulation.  
 ► As the cocoa powder has already been placed on the market by wholesaler J and provided that retailer  
K neither processed nor  supplemented  it before resale, retailer K  is  only making available  a relevant  
product. For the purpose of exercising due diligence and submitting due diligence statements according  
to Article 4(2)  and  (9), retailer K  can refer to  existing DDS  after  ascertaining that  due  diligence was  
exercised properly by wholesaler  J  according to Article 4(9), but retailer K  still retains responsibility  
for compliance.    
   
 Scenario 4c   
   
EU-established  wholesaler  J  (SME  operator)  imports  soya-bean  oil  [HS  1507]  from  a  third  country  
 (non-EU) producer and  sells it to EU-established retailer K (SME trader). Retailer K resells the  soya- 
bean oil within the EU.   
 ►  Wholesaler  J  is  an  operator  when  importing  the  soya-bean  oil  into  the  EU  (i.e.,  declare  for  the  
customs  procedure  ‘release  for  free  circulation’),  as  soya-bean  oil  is  a  relevant  product  covered  by  
Annex I of the EUDR. This means that wholesaler J must exercise due diligence on the soya-bean oil,  
 submit  a  DDS  to  the  Information  System  and  include  the  DDS  reference  number  in  the  customs  
declaration for release for free circulation.   
 ► As the soya-bean oil has already been placed on the market by wholesaler J and provided that retailer  
K neither processed nor supplemented it before reselling, retailer K is only making available a relevant  
product.  Since retailer K  is  an SME  trader, it  does not have the  same  due  diligence  obligations  as  an  
operator.  Retailer  K  must  therefore  collect  and  keep  the  information  required  under  Article  5  of  the  
EUDR, but  it  is not required  to  submit  a  DDS  for the  soya-bean  oil prior to reselling  it  according to  
Article 5(2).   
   
 Scenario 4d   
   
EU-established wholesaler J (SME operator) imports cocoa beans [HS  1801] from a third country (non- 
EU) producer and sells them to EU-established manufacturer K (non-SME operator). Manufacturer K  
uses the cocoa beans to make chocolate bars [HS  1806], which it sells within the EU.   
 ►  Wholesaler  J  is  an  operator  when  importing  the  cocoa  beans  into  the  EU  (declare for   customs  
procedure   ‘release for  free  circulation’), as cocoa beans are a relevant product covered by Annex I of  
the EUDR. This means that wholesaler J must exercise due diligence on the cocoa beans, submit a DDS  
to the Information System and include the DDS reference number in the customs declaration for release  
for free circulation.   
 ► Manufacturer K becomes  an  operator when  selling the  chocolate bars, because  chocolate bars  are  
also a relevant product listed in Annex I of the EUDR and these are being placed on the market (made  
available for  the first  time). For the purpose of exercising due diligence and submitting due diligence  
 statements according to Article 4(2) and (9), retailer K can refer to existing DDS after ascertaining that  
due diligence was exercised properly by wholesaler J according to Article 4(9), but retailer K still retains  
responsibility for compliance.   
   
 Scenario 5 – Using existing DDS as reference  
  
EU-established  company L  (non-SME  operator) purchases  frozen  cattle meat  [HS  ex0202]  from EU- 
established farmer M (SME operator) who has produced the cattle within the EU. Farmer M purchased  
the  feed  of the  cattle  from retailer W  (SME  operator) who  exercised  due  diligence.  Company  L then  

                                                                    36  
﻿  
  

exports the frozen cattle meat [HS ex0202] to a third country. Meat has not been processed into or mixed  
with other relevant products.  
 ► Farmer M  is  an  operator when  selling the  frozen  cattle meat to  company  L  and must  conduct  due  
diligence and submit a DDS for the cattle meat to the Information System before selling. As part of their  
due  diligence  for  the  cattle  meat,  farmer  M must  include  geolocation  information referring  to  all  the  
establishments  where  the  cattle  were  raised  (in  accordance  with  Article  9(1)(d)).  In  accordance  with  
recital (39), farmer M determines whether the cattle were fed with another relevant product, and if so,  
farmer  M  should  use  as  evidence  the  relevant  invoices,  reference  numbers  of  relevant  due  diligence  
statements  or  any other relevant documentation received  from retailer W indicating that the  feed was  
deforestation-free.  
 ► Company L is an operator when exporting the meat from the EU (i.e., declare for the customs export  
procedure).  Company  L  must  therefore  ascertain  that  due  diligence  relating  to  the  cattle  meat  was  
exercised,  and  submit  a  separate DDS, which may refer to the previous DDS  submitted by  farmer M  
according to Article 4(9). If, instead of exporting the meat to a third country, company L decides to sell  
the meat within the EU then company L would be acting as a trader, but they would be subject to the  
same  obligations  as  above,  as  non-SME  traders  are  considered  as  non-SME  operators  according  to  
Article 5(1).   
  
Scenario 6 – Due diligence for natural persons/microenterprises   
   
EU-established  private  forest  owner  N  (SME  operator)  contracts  timber  company  O  (non-SME  
operator) to harvest some of its trees. The company O harvests the trees, but the logs [HS 4403] are still  
owned by the private forest owner N. When the logs are collected, the private forest owner N sells the  
harvested logs to timber company O. Timber company O then sends the logs to their own sawmill and  
places them on the market as sawn wood [HS 4407].   
  
 ► Forest owner N is an operator and must conduct due diligence before placing the logs on the market.  
However, because forest owner N is a natural person/microenterprise , it has the option of mandating  
the next operator or trader further down the supply chain that is not a natural person/microenterprise to  
act as an authorised representative and submit the DDS on their behalf. In case forest owner N chooses  
to  mandate  company  O  to  submit  the  DDS  on  their  behalf,  it  communicates  to  company  O  all  
information necessary to confirm that it has already exercised due diligence and no/negligible risk was  
found according to Article 6(3). Forest owner N retains responsibility for compliance.   
 ► Timber company O is an operator when places on the market sawn wood as a relevant wood product  
covered by Annex I of the EUDR, produced from logs that were harvested in the forest of forest owner  
N.  This  means  that  timber  company  O  must  ascertain  that  due  diligence  relating  to  the  logs  was  
exercised and submit a separate DDS to the Information System before placing on the market the sawn  
wood produced from sawing the trees of forest owner N.   
  
Scenario 7 – Mandating third-parties as authorised representatives  
   
EU-established  retailer  P  (SME  operator)  imports  pneumatic  rubber  tyres  [HS  ex4011]  from  a  third  
country (non-EU) and chooses to mandate EU-established company Q as their authorised representative  
to submit the DDS as a service provider for retailer P.    
 ► Retailer P is an operator when importing into the EU (declare for the customs procedure ‘release for  
free  circulation’)  the  rubber  tyres,  as  rubber  tyres  are  a  relevant  product  covered  by  Annex  I  of  the  
EUDR.  This means that retailer P must exercise due  diligence  on the rubber tyres but, retailer P may  
mandate  company  Q  as  authorised  representative  to  submit  the  DDS  for  the  tyres  on  their  behalf  
according  to  Article  6(1).  Company  Q  does  not  act  as  a  supply  chain  member,  it  is  only  a  service  
provider that submits the DDS to the Information System on retailer P’s behalf and, upon request from  
the competent  authorities, provide  a  copy  of the mandate  according to Article  6(2). Retailer P retains  
responsibility for the tyres’ compliance with Article 3 of the EUDR.   
   

                                                                  37  
﻿   
   

  Scenario 8 – Product coverage  
    
 EU-established manufacturer R  (SME operator) imports palm oil  [HS  1511] from third country  (non- 
 EU) producers into the EU and processes it within their factory into soap [HS 3401] which it sells within  
 the EU.    
 ►  Manufacturer  R  is  an  operator  when  importing  into  the  EU  (declare  for  the  customs  procedure  
 ‘release for free circulation’) the palm oil, as palm oil is a relevant product covered by Annex I of the  
 EUDR. This means that R must exercise due diligence,  submit a DDS to the Information  System and  
 include the DDS reference number in the customs declaration for release for free circulation.   
 ► However, when selling the soap, manufacturer R is not required to exercise due diligence or submit  
 a DDS for the palm oil contained in the soap, as the soap itself is not a relevant product listed in Annex  
 I of the EUDR.    
    
 Scenario 9 – Placing relevant products on the market by an SME operator   
   
 Scenario 9a  
    
 EU-established soya merchant S (non-SME trader) buys soya beans [HS  1201] that were already placed  
 on  the  market  by  another  company.  EU-established  non-SME  merchant  S  sells  soya  beans  to  EU- 
 established  company  T  (SME  operator).  Company  T  creates  soya  bean  flour  [HS  1208  10]  from  the  
 soya beans and sells them.  
 ► Merchant  S is a non-SME trader when selling (making available) the soya beans to company T, as  
 soya beans are a relevant product covered by Annex I of the EUDR. This means that merchant  S must  
 ascertain  that  due  diligence  relating  to  the  soya  beans  was  exercised  and  submit  a  new  DDS  to  the  
 Information  System in which  S may reference the existing DDS provided by the supplier according to  
 Article  4(9)  before  selling  the  soya  beans  to  company  T.  Merchant  S  still  retains  responsibility  for  
 compliance.  
 ► Company T is an operator when placing the soya bean flour on the market by selling them, as it has  
 processed the  soya beans into a new product  (the soya bean flour), which is a relevant product with a  
 separate HS code under EUDR Annex I. Since this sale by company T is a placing on the market (first   
 making available) of a new relevant product, company T is an operator. As an SME enterprise, company  
 T is not required to perform due diligence before placing the soya bean flour on the market nor to submit  
 a  due  diligence  statement  in  the  Information  System because  the  soya  bean  flour  is  made  from  soya  
 beans  that  have  already  been  subject  to  due  diligence  and  for  which  a  due  diligence  statement  has  
 already  been  submitted  by  merchant   S  according  to  Article  4(8),  but  company  T  still  retains  
 responsibility for compliance.    
   
 Scenario 9b  

 EU-established private  forest  owner U  (SME  operator) harvests  some  of  its  own  trees to process the  
 logs into sawn wood [HS4407] in his own business to sell it directly to other businesses.   
 ► Forest owner U is an operator when selling the sawn wood, meaning Forest owner U has to exercise  
 due diligence and submit a DDS for the sawn wood before selling it, rather than before harvesting the  
 logs.   
   
 [If,  in the above scenario 9b, forest  owner  U would harvest some of  its  trees to create sawn wood for   
 its own use in its home such as for  its fence,  it would not be an operator and would consequentially not  
 be subject to obligations under the EUDR. Same would apply if it would process  other relevant product s  
for  own personal  use from  the trees, such as furniture  for  its house or wooden photo  frames,  or use the  
 logs to heat its own house.]    
   
 Scenario 10 – Relevant products offered for sales online or by other means of distance sales  
   

                                                                    38  
﻿  
  

EU  established  person  V  (SME  trader)  buys  wooden  photo  frames  [HS  4414]  for  subsequent  sale  
through their online craft shop in the course of a commercial activity. The wooden photo frames were  
already subject to due diligence by operator Z.  
► Person V is a trader when making available on the market the wooden photo frames, or an operator  
in case exporting the wooden frames to a third country, as wooden frames are a relevant product under  
EUDR Annex I. EUDR  contains no provision whereby the mere  offering for  sales  online  or by  other  
means  of distance  sales  is deemed to be making  available  on the market  or  an  export. Person V must  
comply with EUDR prior to entering into contractual purchase agreement with the buyer of the wooden  
photo frames.

1.        Traceability   

1.1.      Why and how must operators collect coordinates? (UPDATED)   

The  Regulation  requires  operators  placing  covered  products  on  the  EU   
market  to  collect   
geographic coordinates of the plots of land where the commodities were produced.   

Traceability to the plot of land (i.e., the requirement to collect the geographic  
coordinates of   
the plots of land where the commodities were produced) is necessary to demonstrate  
that   
there   has  been  no  deforestation   at  the   specific  location   of   
production.  Geographic   
information linking products to the plot of land is already used by part of the  
industry and a   
number  of  certification  organisations.  Remotely  sensed  information  (air   
photos,  satellite   
images)  or  other  information  (e.g.,  photograph  in  the  field  with  linked   
geotags  and  time   
stamps) may be used for verifying if the geolocation of declared commodities and  
products is   
linked to deforestation.   

The      geolocation        coordinates        need      to     be     provided      
 in    the     due      diligence   
statements (hereinafter referred to as “Due Diligence Statement” or “DDS”) that  
operators   
are required to submit to the Information System  ahead of the placing on the  EU  
market or   
                                                 1  
export  from  the  EU  of  the  products  .  It  is  therefore  a  core  part  of   
the  Regulation,  which   
prohibits  the  placing  on  the  EU  market,  or  the  export,  of  any  product   
﻿covered  by  the   
Regulation’s scope whose geolocation coordinates have not yet been collected and  
submitted   
as part of a due diligence statement.   

Collecting  the  geolocation  coordinates  of  a  plot  of  land  can  be  done  via 
 mobile  phones,   
handheld Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) devices and widespread and  
free-to-use   
digital applications (e.g. Geographic Information Systems (GIS)). These do not  
require mobile   
network coverage, only a solid GNSS signal, like those provided  by Galileo.   

For  plots  of  land  of  more  than  4  hectares  used  for  the  production  of   
commodities  other   
than cattle, the geolocation must be provided using polygons, meaning latitude and  
longitude   
points of six decimal digits to describe the perimeter of each plot of land. For  
plots of land   
under 4 hectares, operators can use a polygon or a single point of latitude and  
longitude of   
six  decimal  digits  to  provide  geolocation.  Establishments  where  cattle  are  
kept  can  be   
described with a single point of geolocation coordinate.   

Please  note  that  the  Regulation  does  not  impose  direct  obligations  on   
producers  in  third   
country (unless they are directly placing products on the EU market).   

For the obligations of downstream non-SME operators and non-SME traders, see FAQ  
3.4.   

                                          
1 The functioning of the Information System is set out in Commission Implementing  
Regulation (EU) 2024/3084,   

Implementing regulation -  EU -  2024/3084 -  EN -  EUR-Lex. Further information is  
available in Chapter 7 of this   
document.   

                                                           12   
   
    

1.2.     Should all commodities (imported, exported, traded) be traceable? (UPDATED) 
  

The  traceability  requirements  apply  to  each  batch  of   
imported/exported/traded  relevant   
commodities.   
﻿The Regulation requires that operators trace every relevant commodity back to its  
plot of   
land before making a relevant product available or placing it on the  EU  market, or 
before   
exporting it. Consequently, the submission of the due diligence statement which  
includes   
geolocation information is a requirement for the relevant products to be imported  
(customs   
procedure ‘release for free circulation’) and to be exported (customs procedure  
‘export’) and   
the consignment for transactions within the  EU market.  In the case of export, the  
necessary   
information can be provided by referencing previous DDS  in the case of downstream  
non-  
SME operators (see FAQ 3.4., for SMEs at export see FAQ 5.6.1).   

1.3.     How does it work for bulk-traded or composite products? (UPDATED)   

For products traded in bulk, such as soy or palm oil for instance, this means that  
the operator   
needs  to  ensure  that  all  plots  of  land  involved  in  a  shipment  are   
identified  and  that  the   
commodities are not mixed at any step of the process with commodities of unknown  
origin   
or from areas deforested or degraded after the cut-off date of 31 December 2020.   

For   relevant composite products,   such   as   e.g.   wooden   furniture   with    
different   wood   
components,  the  operator  needs  to  geolocate  all  the  plots  of  land  where   
the  relevant   
commodity (wood, for example) used for the manufacturing process has been produced.  
This   
can be done by collecting the geolocations or referencing a previous DDS that  
contains the   
geolocations of all plots of land.  The relevant commodities’ components may be  
neither of   
unknown origin nor from areas deforested or degraded after the cut-off date.   

In  the  case  of  composite  products  containing  multiple  different  relevant   
commodities  or   
products  (for example, a chocolate bar containing cocoa powder, cocoa butter and  
palm oil,   
or wooden furniture with leather components), the operator placing such a product on 
the   
EU  market  or  exporting  from  it  will  need  to  conduct  due  diligence  only   
on  the  main   
commodity   and  (derived)  products   deemed  relevant  under  the  EUDR,  this   
being  the   
commodity contained in the left  column of Annex I. For  example, for  chocolate  
﻿bars  (Code   
1806),  the  relevant  commodity  linked  to  it  is  cocoa.  This  means  that  the 
 due  diligence   
obligation and information requirements extend only to relevant products  listed in  
the right   
column of Annex I  under the relevant  commodity  which  the  chocolate  bar  
contains or has   
been  made  using,  which  in  this  case  is  the  cocoa  powder  and  cocoa   
butter  under  the   
commodity cocoa.   

1.4.     Are mass balance chains of custody allowed?   

The Regulation requires that the commodities used for all products falling under the 
scope be   
traceable to the plot of land.   

Mass balance chains of custody that allow for the mixing, at any step of the supply  
chain, of   
deforestation-free commodities with commodities of unknown origin or  
non-deforestation-  
free commodities are not allowed  under the Regulation, because they do not  
guarantee that   
the commodities placed on the  EU  market,  or exported, are deforestation-free.  
Therefore,   

                                                        13   
   
    

the  commodities  placed  on  the   EU  market,  or  exported,  need  to  be   
segregated  from   
commodities of unknown origin or from non-deforestation-free commodities at every  
step of   
the supply chain. As mass balance is therefore to be ruled out, full identity  
preservation is not   
needed.   

1.5.      What if part of a product is non-compliant?   

If part of a relevant product is non-compliant, the non-compliant part needs to be  
identified   
and  separated  from  the  rest before  the  relevant  product  is  placed  on  the  
EU  market  or   
exported, and that part may be neither placed on the EU market nor exported.    

If  identification  and  separation  cannot  be  done,  for  instance  because  the  
non-compliant   
products have been mixed with the rest, then the whole relevant product is  
non-compliant   
﻿as  it  cannot  be  guaranteed  that  the  conditions  of  Art.  3  of  the   
Regulation  are  met  and   
therefore it may be neither placed on the  EU market nor exported.   

For instance, when bulk commodities have all been mixed and are linked to several  
hundred   
plots of land, the fact that one of the plots of land has been deforested after 2020 
would   
make the whole relevant batch  non-compliant.   

A  product would  however  not  be  non-compliant  where  100%  of  relevant   
commodities  or   
relevant products placed on the  EU market 1) can be traced to the plot of land, 2)  
are  legal   
and deforestation free within the meaning of the  Regulation, and 3) at no point in  
time has   
been mixed with commodities of unknown origin or non-deforestation-free.   

1.6.      What are the rules for land that is not real-estate?    

What happens with public or communal land that does not fall within the concept of  
“real-  
estate property”?   

The Regulation requires that commodities placed on the  EU market or exported must  
have   
been produced or harvested on the land designated as a plot of land. The absence of  
a land   
registry or formal title should not prevent the designation of land that is de facto 
used as a   
plot of land (see below).    

1.7.      What is the size of the area (hectares) that can be covered by a polygon?  
  

There  is  not  a  fixed  threshold  on  the  minimum  or  maximum  size  for  plots 
 of  land  in  the   
Regulation, as  long as  the plot  of  land  captures  the precise area of  
production and enjoys   
sufficiently homogeneous conditions to allow an evaluation of the aggregate level of 
risk of   
deforestation  and  forest  degradation  associated  with  relevant  products   
produced  on  that   
land. See also question 1 in relation to the geographic coordinates for plots of  
under 4 ha.    

There is no limit in the  area  of polygons that can be imported into the  
Information System,   
but the total file size of the DDS cannot exceed 25 Mb.   
﻿                                                         14   
   
    

1.8.      Does geolocation need to be provided by means of polygons in all cases?    

No. For plots of land of a size  below four hectares (only), geolocation can be  
described with   
one latitude and longitude point only. In case of cattle, no polygons but only  
single geolocation   
points required, notably for all ‘establishments’ (as defined  in Art.  2(29)  of  
the Regulation),   
where cattle have been held.   
   
1.9.      (DELETED and information moved to question 7.26)    

1.10.     What if property registers or titles are unavailable?   

How  can  operators  and  traders  that  are  not  SMEs  obtain  geolocation  data   
in  countries   
where property registers are incomplete and where farmers may lack IDs or titles  
over their   
land? (UPDATED)   

Farmers  can  collect  the  geolocation  of  their  plots  of  land  regardless  of  
whether  they  are   
entered or not in  a land registry or the lack of IDs or titles over their land.  
Unless they are   
direct suppliers of the operators or operators themselves, no personal information  
is required   
from the farmers and the geolocation of the  plot used to supply commodities for  
placing on   
the EU market is sufficient.   

As  regards  the  legality  requirement   in  relation  to  land  use  right  (Art.  
2(40)(a)  of  the   
Regulation)  the Regulation requires compliance with relevant national laws. If  
farmers are   
legally allowed to sell their product under national laws (which might lack a  
property register   
and where some farmers might lack IDs), then that would also mean that operators (or 
traders   
that are not SMEs) would meet the legality requirement when sourcing from those  
farmers.   
If possession of a land title is not required under domestic law to produce and  
commercialise   
agricultural products, then it is not required under the  Regulation. Operators (or  
traders that   
are not SMEs),  nonetheless,  would  need  to  verify that there is no  risk of  
illegality in their   
﻿supply  chains,  meaning  that  relevant  laws  applicable  in  the  country  of   
production  are   
complied with.    

There are many different means that operators (or traders that are not SMEs) already 
use   
today to collect the legality  (and geolocation)  information: some resort to  
mapping directly   
their  suppliers,  while  others  rely  on  intermediaries  like  cooperatives,   
certification  bodies,   
national traceability systems or other companies. Operators (or traders that are not 
SMEs)   
are legally responsible for ensuring that the geolocation and legality information  
is correct,   
regardless of the means or intermediaries they use to collect that information .   

1.11.     Can an operator use the producer’s geolocation data?   

Yes, but it is the operator who is ultimately responsible for its accuracy and not  
the producer   
who  provides  it.  The  Regulation  does  not  apply  to  producers  which  do  not 
 directly  place   
products  on  the  European  Union  market  (and  thus  do  not  fall  under  the   
definition  of   
operators and traders).   

In such a case, the operator will have to ensure that the area where the relevant  
commodity   
was produced is correctly mapped and that the geolocation corresponds to the plot of 
land.   

                                                          15   
   
    

Among measures which the operator can use are support for suppliers to meet  
requirements   
of  this  Regulation,  in  particular  for  smallholders,  through  capacity   
building  and  other   
investments.   

1.12.     Should operators verify the geo-location? (UPDATED)   

Operators need to verify and be able to prove that the geolocation is correct.   

 Ensuring the truthfulness and precision of geolocation information is a crucial  
aspect of the   
responsibilities  that  operators  must  fulfil.  Providing  incorrect  geolocation  
details  would   
constitute a breach of the obligations of operators under the Regulation.   
﻿1.13.     Should due diligence be repeated for products from the same land?  
(UPDATED)   

The geolocation information obligation to be provided in the DDS, via the  
Information System,   
is connected to each relevant product. Operators (or traders that are not SMEs) will 
thus need   
to indicate this information each time they intend to place, make available on the   
EU market   
or  export  a  relevant  product.  The  due  diligence  must  be  repeated  (i.e.   
updated)  for  each   
relevant product, including providing the geolocation coordinates accordingly. The  
necessary   
information  can  be  provided  by  referencing  previous  DDS  after  ascertaining  
that  due   
diligence was exercised upstream (see FAQ 3.4.).   

1.14.     Can a polygon cover several plots of land?   

 Polygons are to be used to describe the perimeter of the plots of land where the  
commodity   
has   been   produced. Each   polygon   should   indicate   one   single   plot   of 
  land,   whether   
contiguous or not. Where relevant products are  made of commodities from several  
plots of   
land, several polygons must be provided in one due diligence statement. A polygon  
cannot be   
used to trace the perimeter of an  area  of land that might include plots of land  
only in some   
of its parts.   

1.15.   What if a relevant commodity is produced on a plot of land within a single  
estate   
   property, including also other plots of land?    

The situation may be best described with the following  illustration.   

   

                                                                                     
                  

        i)     If the relevant  commodity (soy, in  the  example) is  produced in  
area B, which   
               geolocation should be provided?    

                                                            16   
   
    
﻿Based on definition of plot of land (“land within a single real estate property”)  
the operator   
should  provide  only  the  geolocation  of  the  plot  of  land  where  the   
relevant  commodity  is   
produced (area B, in the example)   

       ii)     What if deforestation in area C is legal and after the cut-off date?  
  

     -    if no relevant commodity is produced in area C, deforestation in area C  
does not affect   
          the compliance of soy produced in area B    
     -    If another relevant commodity (e.g. cattle) is produced in area C, then  
cattle is non-  
          compliant (non-deforestation free), but soy from area B is, in principle,  
compliant    
     -    If the same commodity is produced in areas B and C (soy), the operator  
will have to   
          achieve negligible risk, taking into particular account the high risk of  
mixing within the   
          single property (Art.  10(2)(j))   
             
       iii)    What  if  the  legal  status  of  the  real  estate  property  A  is  
affected  by  illegality   
               within     the   meaning       of   the    Regulation   (for         
instance,     if  there     is  illegal   
               deforestation in area C)? Is the soy produced in area B affected?    

The soy produced in area B is not legal, and therefore not compliant, since the  
legal status of   
the area of production (so not the plot of land, but the whole property, in line  
with Art. 2 (40))   
is not complying with the relevant legislation of the country of production.   

1.16.     Should polygons be provided by means of circumference?   

There  is  neither  an  obligation  nor  a  possibility  to  provide  the  plot  of  
land  information  by   
means of circumference.  For plots of land of more than four hectares (for the  
production of   
the relevant commodities other than cattle), geolocation has to be provided using  
polygons   
(not a unique central point with a circumference) with sufficient latitude and  
longitude points   
to describe the perimeter of each plot of land.   

1.17.     How should the place of production of mixed goods be declared? (UPDATED)   
﻿The operator needs to declare the place of production of all goods effectively  
shipped to the   
EU.    
    
For example, if compliant goods from multiple places of production are mixed into  
the same   
silo, stack, pile, tank, etc., and then some of those goods are placed on the EU  
market:    
   
     •    The place of production declared should include the place of production of 
all goods   
          that  entered  the  silo  since  it  was  last  empty (and  could   
therefore  potentially  be   
          included in the shipment)    
     •    If the silos are not regularly emptied, the operator would need to declare 
the place of   
          production of all goods that entered the silo during a period of time that 
ensures that   
          commodities of unknown place of production are not mixed up in the  
process. For   
          instance, when downloading part of the goods stored in the silo, this  
could be safely   
          done by declaring the geolocation of all previous goods that entered the  
silo up to a   
          minimum of 200% of the silo capacity, provided that the silo works in  
first-in first-out   
          system  or  an  equivalent  system  that  ensures  the  chronological   
exhaustion  of  raw   

                                                            17   
   
    

          materials in the order of their entry. This approach applies to relevant  
commodities   
          or   products   stored   in   stacks,   tanks,   etc.   and   all    
continuous   processing. Other   
          approaches are possible  for first-in  first-out as well as for other  
storage systems  as   
          long as it is ensured that commodities from an unknown place of production 
or which   
          are incompliant with EUDR are not mixed up in the process.    
     •    Declaring the place of production of x amount of goods that entered the  
silo, where x   
          is  the  amount  placed  on  the  EU is  not  allowed  under  the   
Regulation,  as  it  would   
          violate the prohibition under the Regulation of placing products of  
unknown origin on   
          the Union market.    
                 
﻿This is without prejudice to the transitional provisions as described in section 9.  

   
1.18.     Under  which  circumstances  can  operators  declare  more  plots  of   
land  in  a  due   
  diligence  statement  than  those  actually  concerned  by  the  production  of   
the  specific   
  commodity placed on the market? What are the implications of a “declaration in  
excess”?   
  (UPDATED)   

The thrust of the regulation requires a correspondence between the  
commodities/products   
placed on the market and the plots of land where they are effectively produced  
(hence, the   
regulation is built on the principle of strict traceability, whereby operators need  
to collect the   
precise geolocation coordinates corresponding to the plots of land of production).  
However,   
an  operator  can,  in  specific  circumstances,  provide  geolocation  coordinates  
for  a  limited   
number of plots of land higher than those where the commodities were produced:   

Operators may declare "in excess" only in situations where a bulk commodity is fully 
traced   
to the plot of land and is not being subject to mixing with commodity of unknown  
origin or   
non-compliant commodities. When such bulk commodity is mixed up along the   
logistical or   
production process, for instance in silos for storage, onboard ships for  
transportation, or in   
mills during the production process, the operator can resort to a declaration in  
excess if and   
when  only  a  part  of  the  whole  is  placed  on  the  market.  Operators are   
required  to  obtain   
traceability data that is as granular as possible.   

Declaration in excess can also be applied in case of crop rotation on a set of  
agricultural land   
plots on a farm, where e.g. soy is produced each year in a different part of the  
farm’s total   
arable land area.   

If the operator declares ‘in excess’ in the due diligence statement, the operator  
assumes full   
responsibility for compliance of all plots of land for which geolocation is  
provided, regardless   
of  whether  such  plots  of  land  are  concerned  by  the  production  of   
commodities/products   
eventually  placed  on  the  market.  If  one  plot  of  land  ‘geolocalised’  in   
﻿the  due  diligence   
statement is not compliant, the entire set of plots of land ‘geolocalised’ is  
non-compliant. In   
these  cases  the  operator  declaring  plots  of  land  in  excess  also  has  to   
fully  carry  out  due   
diligence in compliance with the obligations under the EUDR, for all plots of land  
declared   
(including those in excess) and has to provide evidence that 1) the risk of  
non-compliance   
(regarding  the  deforestation-free  and  the  legality  requirement)  has  been   
assessed  in   
accordance with Art. 10(2) EUDR for all plots of land, 2) that, in such assessment,  
the operator   
has taken particular account of criteria (i) and (j), of Art. 10 EUDR, and 3) that  
such risk is   

                                                           18   
   
    

negligible for all plots of land. In more detail, the operator has to consider the  
existence of a   
risk if connecting relevant products to the plots of land where the relevant  
commodities were   
produced is difficult according to Art. 10(2)(i) EUDR, and also if the risk of  
circumvention of   
the  Regulation  or  of  mixing  with  relevant  products  of  unknown  origin  is   
non-negligible   
according to Art. 10(2)(j) EUDR. The operator has to mitigate these risks to  
negligible level   
before placing or making available such products on the market or exporting them.   

With no prejudice to the above-mentioned case scenarios, traceability practices that 
aim to   
declare an excessive amount of plots of land (for instance, on a regional or  
country-wide basis)   
are  generally  not  in  line  with  the  rules  of  this  regulation.  Such   
practices  would  not  allow   
operators to comply with their core due diligence obligations, in particular  
mitigating risk of   
circumvention (i.e., it is not possible to conduct due diligence as per Art. 8 of  
the Regulation   
on  an  entire  country).  It  would  also  hinder  the  work  of  EU  Member   
States  Competent   
Authorities, making it difficult (or even impossible) to comply with their  
obligations to carry   
out checks as per Art. 16.   

1.19.     How will geolocation allow claims to be checked in practice? (UPDATED)   
﻿How will geolocation allow for checking the validity of a no-deforestation claim in  
practice?   
Is it aligning satellite navigation positioning and deforestation maps? Will there  
be baseline   
maps that forest areas or areas that have undergone deforestation and forest  
degradation?   
How will it work if geolocation of farms, plantations or concessions are not  
available?   

It is the responsibility of the operator  to collect the geolocation coordinates of  
the plots of   
land where the commodities were produced. If the operator cannot collect the  
geolocation   
of all plots of land contributing to a relevant product, then they should not place  
that product   
on the EU market or export it, in accordance with Art. 3 of the Regulation.   

1.20.    Operators (and traders which are not SMEs) and enforcing authorities  may   
cross-  
  check the geolocation coordinates against satellite images or forest cover maps to 
assess   
  if the products meet the deforestation-free requirement of the Regulation.  How  
will the   
  EU check the validity of a no-deforestation claim?   

The  EU  Member  States’  Competent  Authorities  (EUMS  CAs)  should  carry  out   
checks  to   
establish that the relevant commodities and products that have been or are intended  
to be   
placed on or made available on the  EU  market or exported, come from  
deforestation-free   
plots of land and were produced legally (in accordance with Art. 16  of the  
Regulation). This   
includes conducting checks on the validity of the due diligence statements, and the  
overall   
compliance of the operators and traders with the provisions of the Regulation.   

For more information on the scope of EUMS CAs obligations, please refer to Arts.  18 
and 19   
of the Regulation.   

                                                         19   
   
    

1.21.    What  type  of  checks  may  EU  Member  States  Competent  Authorities   
carry  out  in   
  third countries in case a product is deemed potentially non-compliant with the  
EUDR?   
﻿Competent Authorities may conduct field audits in third countries pursuant to Art.  
18(2)(e) of   
the  Regulation,  provided  that  such  third  countries  agree,  through   
cooperation  with  the   
administrative authorities of those third countries.   

It should be noted that the Regulation does not require the  EU Member States’   
Competent   
Authorities to consult producing countries if a product is assessed ‘potentially  
non-compliant'   
or ‘non- compliant’.   

1.22.    Will Competent Authorities use the definitions in the Regulation?   

In  the  context  of  the  implementation  of  this  Regulation,  Competent   
Authorities  of  EU   
Member        States will    use    the    definitions     set    out    in   Art.   
2    of   the    Regulation.   
A Regulation is a binding legislative act in the EU. It must be applied in a  
harmonized manner   
in its entirety in the 27 EU Member States.   

1.23.    What is supply chain traceability? (UPDATED)   

The information, documents and data which operators, and traders that are not SMEs  
where   
applicable,  need  to  collect  and  keep  for  5  years  to  demonstrate   
compliance  with  the   
Regulation are listed in Art. 9 and Annex II as well as in Art. 2(28) of the  
Regulation as regards   
data related to geolocation.   

Operators should exercise due diligence with regard to all relevant products  
supplied by each   
particular supplier. Therefore, they should put in place a due diligence system,  
which includes   
the collection of information, data and documents needed to fulfil the requirements  
set out   
in Art. 9; risk assessment measures as described in Art. 10; and  risk mitigation  
measures as   
referred  to  in  Art.  11  of  the  Regulation.  The  requirements  for  the   
establishment  and   
maintenance of due diligence systems, reporting and record keeping are listed in  
Art. 12  of   
the Regulation. The operators will have to communicate to operators and to traders  
further   
down  the  supply  chain  all  information  necessary  to  demonstrate  that  due   
diligence  was   
exercised and that no or only a negligible risk was found  pursuant to Art. 4(7)  
EUDR.   
﻿Operators and traders further down the supply chain that receive such information  
may base   
their own due diligence on the information received, but the fact that another  
operator or   
trader further up in the value chain has carried out a due diligence does by no  
means disapply   
their  own  obligations.  For  obligations  of  non-SME  downstream  operators  and  
non-SME   
traders see FAQ 3.4.   

Operators and traders which are not SMEs are required to ensure that the information 
on   
traceability that they supply to enforcing authorities in the Member States through  
the due   
diligence statement submitted to the Information System is correct.     

The development and functioning of the Information System will be in line with the  
relevant   
data protection provisions. In addition, the system will be equipped with security  
measures   
that will ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the information shared.   

                                                         20   
   
    

1.24.     How will traceability work for products from multiple countries?   

Operators and traders that are not SMEs are required to ensure that the required  
information   
on   traceability   that   they   supply   to   competent   authorities   in   the   
Member   States   is   
correct, regardless of the length or the complexity of their supply chains.   

Traceability  information  can  be  added  up  along  supply  chains.  For   
instance,  a  large,  bulk   
shipment of soy that has been sourced in several hundred plots of land from several  
countries   
would  need  to  be  associated  with  a  due  diligence  statement  that  includes  
all  relevant   
countries of production and geolocation information for every single plot of land  
from all of   
these countries that have contributed to the shipment.   

1.25.     What is the ‘date or time range of production’? (UPDATED)   

Operators are required to collect information on the date or time range of  
production under   
the obligations  set out  in  Art.  9  of the  Regulation. This information is  
﻿needed to  establish   
whether the relevant product is deforestation-free. That is why it applies to the  
commodities   
covered by the Regulation that are placed on the  EU market or to the commodities  
that are   
used for the production of relevant products covered by the regulation.    
     
For commodities other than cattle, the date of production refers to the date of  
harvesting of   
the  commodities,  and  the  time  range  of  production  refers  to the   
period/duration  of  the   
production process (for  instance,  in the  case  of timber, “time range of  
production” would   
refer to the duration of the relevant harvesting operations). The date of production 
and the   
time range of production should both be related to the designated plots of land.     
     
If more precise information is not available, due to the specificities of the  
production, the crop   
year and/or harvesting season could be used.    
   
For relevant products under the commodity “cattle”, the time range of production  
refers to   
the  lifetime  of  the  animals  from  the  moment  the  cattle  were   born  until  
the  time  of   
slaughtering. If live cattle (HS Code 0102 21, 0102 29) are  placed on the EU market 
(e.g., by   
importing or by the first selling of a cow after it was born in the EU), all  
geolocations until the   
first placing on the  EU market will have to be collected and submitted with the due 
diligence   
statement (DDS). If live cattle are  subsequently made available on the  EU market,  
non-SME   
traders will be obliged to collect and add all additional geolocations of  
establishments where   
the  cattle  were  kept  after  the  first  placing  on  the   EU  market  (see   
Art.  9(1)(d)  of  the   
Regulation).  In the case of SME traders, they will not have to add their  
geolocations nor issue   
new  DDS but  should keep the information  relating to the relevant products they  
intend to   
make available on the market for at least 5 years as set out in Art. 5(3) and 5(4).  

    
To  note  that,  according  to  Art.  1(2)  of  the  Regulation,  and  in  line   
with  the  definition  of   
“produced” in Art. 2(14), the EUDR does not apply to cattle and cattle derived  
products if the   
cattle was born before the entry into force of the Regulation, i.e. before 29 June  
2023.    
﻿   

                                                              21   
   
    

1.26.     How does traceability work for cattle? (UPDATED)   

Would  it  be  enough  to  provide  the  geolocation  of  the  land  where  the   
calf  was  born?   
Some cattle may be moved to one or more locations before slaughter.    

Operators (or traders that are not SMEs) who place on the  EU market cattle products 
must   
geolocate  or  refer  to  a  DDS  containing  geolocations  of  all  establishments  
associated  with   
raising the cattle, encompassing the birthplace, farms where they were fed, grazing  
lands,   
and  slaughterhouses  in  case  the  cattle  is  kept  in  this  establishment  (but 
 only  geolocation   
corresponding to one latitude and one longitude  point, not  polygons, is required  
for each of   
these ‘establishments’).    

1.26.1  How should operators fulfil obligations related to “feed used for  
livestock”? (NEW)   

According to Recital 39 of the Regulation, operators placing or making available on  
the market   
or exporting relevant products that have been made using cattle should ensure, as  
part of   
their due diligence system, that the feed used for livestock is deforestation-free.  
However, no   
geolocation information should be required for the feed itself .   

Taking into  account that  EUDR imposes requirements on relevant products,  feed  
used for   
livestock is relevant under EUDR only if such feed is a relevant product at the time 
of being   
fed (e.g., HS 1208 10 – soya bean flour and meal).   

A DDS for the feed included in Annex I must be  submitted  only when it  is  placed  
or  made   
available on the market or exported in its own right.   

In case that the feed used for livestock has already been subject to due diligence  
in a previous   
step of the supply chain, exercising the due diligence on cattle and derived  
relevant products   
may include relevant invoices, reference numbers of relevant due diligence  
﻿statements or any   
other relevant documentation as evidence of the feed is deforestation-free. The  
evidence can   
be requested  by  Competent Authorities  during an  investigation in case they  
obtain or  are   
made aware of relevant information, including information based on substantiated  
concerns   
submitted by third parties that there is a risk of the feed not being in compliance  
with the   
EUDR. The evidence should cover the lifetime of the animals, up to a maximum of five 
years.   

1.27.    What if upstream suppliers do not provide required information? (UPDATED)   

If  an  operator  or  a  trader  placing  or  making  available  a  commodity  on   
the  EU  market  or   
exporting it is unable to obtain the information required by the Regulation from its 
suppliers,   
they must refrain from placing or making available the relevant products on the EU  
market or   
exporting them from the EU as that would result in a violation of the Regulation.    

1.28.    Should coordinates be provided for land in countries classified as  
low-risk?   

There  is no  exception for  the  traceability  requirement  via  geolocation. The   
operators  also   
have to assess the complexity of the relevant supply chain and the risk of  
circumvention of   
the Regulation and the risk of mixing with products of unknown origin or origin in  
high-risk or   
standard-risk countries or parts thereof (Art. 13 of the Regulation).  If the  
operator obtains or   
is  made  aware  of  any  relevant  information  that  would  point  to  a  risk   
that  the  relevant   

                                                         22   
   
    

products  do  not  comply  with  the  Regulation  or  that  the  Regulation  is   
circumvented,  the   
operator  must  fulfil  all  the  obligations  under  Art.  10  and  11  of  the   
Regulation  and  must   
immediately communicate any relevant information to the competent authority.   

1.29.     Does the legality requirement apply to deforestation-free land?   

Relevant commodities cannot be made available on the  EU  market or exported from  
the EU   
﻿unless they have been produced in accordance with the relevant legislation of the  
country of   
production pursuant to Art. 3(b) of the Regulation (the so-called “legality  
requirement”).   

The  obligations  under  Art.  3  are  cumulative,  meaning  they  all  have  to  be 
 fulfilled : (1) the   
legality requirement (Art. 3(b)) ; (2) the ‘deforestation-free’ requirement (Art.  
3(a)) and (3)   
the requirement for the commodities or products to be covered by a due diligence  
statement   
(Art. 3(c) of the Regulation).   

1.29.1  In which cases can legislation be deemed relevant even where it is not  
linked to the   
          EUDR's objectives of halting deforestation and forest degradation? (NEW)   

As set out in the  introductory part of the definition in Art. 2(40) EUDR,  
legislation is relevant   
if  it  concerns  the  legal  status  of  the  area  of  production,  meaning  where 
 laws  specifically   
impact or influence the legal status of the area in which the commodities were  
produced.    

Art. 2(40) EUDR further specifies  that this may include,  among others,  trade  and 
customs   
laws.  Such  laws,  which  by  their  nature  do  not  concern  the  legal  status   
of  the  area  of   
production, can also be relevant if they specifically concern the relevant sectors  
of agricultural   
or timber production – this could, for example,  be the case if specific  
agricultural or forest-  
related documents need to be supplied at customs or as part of trade laws of the  
country of   
production.    

1.29.2  A  commodity  is  harvested  in  country  A  and  transported  to  country   
B  for  further   
          manufacturing (e.g. cocoa beans from A are manufactured into cocoa powder  
in B)   
          before  the  cocoa  powder  is  placed  on  the  EU  market  in  country   
C.  The  laws   
          applicable in which country are relevant? (NEW)   

In   the   given   example,   country   A   is  the   country   of  production,    
meaning  the   legality   
requirement only covers laws that are applicable in country A.   

1.30.     Are there legal obligations for non-EU countries?   
﻿There  are  no  legal  obligations  applicable  to  non-EU  countries.  This   
Regulation  sets  out   
obligations for operators and traders (as defined in chapter 2 of the Regulation) as 
well as for   
the EU Member States and their Competent Authorities (see chapter 3 of the  
Regulation).   

However, many countries around the world have taken action to enhance  
deforestation-free   
supply chains, strengthen public traceability systems on relevant commodities, etc., 
thereby   
facilitating   the   tasks   of   companies   under   this   Regulation.   This   is 
  welcome,   as   such   
developments can greatly help operators and traders to comply with their  
obligations.   

                                                          23   
   
    

1.31.     How can producers share the geolocation data when certain governments  
prohibit   
  the sharing of such data? (UPDATED)   

One of the core requirements for operators under this Regulation is to collect the  
geolocation   
information on the plot(s) of land where commodities and products placed on or  
exported   
from the EU market have been produced (Art. 9(1)(d)  of the Regulation). Operators  
cannot   
rely  on  the  existence  of  national  laws  prohibiting  the  sharing  of  such   
(public)  data  with   
operators and traders in order to be exempt from the obligation to collect and  
upload that   
data into the Information System. Operators must submit the geolocation information  
as part   
of their obligations;  otherwise, the operators and traders  when referring to  
previous DDS,   
cannot comply  with the  requirements on  due  diligence  according to  Art. 8  and, 
 therefore   
cannot place on, make available on or export relevant products from the  EU  market. 
  

   

                                                           °°°°   

   

2.        Scope   
﻿2.1.      What products are included in the Regulation?   

The Regulation applies only to products listed in Annex I. Products not included in  
Annex I are   
not subject to the requirements of the Regulation, even if they contain relevant  
commodities   
in the scope of the Regulation. For example, soap will not be covered by the  
Regulation, even   
if it contains palm oil.   

Likewise,  products  with  an  HS  code  not  included  in  Annex  I,  but  which   
might  include   
components or elements derived from commodities covered by the Regulation – such as  
cars   
with  leather  seats  or  natural  rubber  tyres  –  are  not  subject  to  the   
requirements  of  the   
Regulation.   

N.B.: The Regulation foresees that the list of relevant products and product  
descriptions may   
be amended by the Commission by means of a delegated act. In addition, the  
Commission   
will  assess  the  need  and  the  feasibility  of  making  a  legislative  proposal 
 to  the  European   
Parliament and to the Council to extend the scope of the Regulation to further  
commodities,   
based  on  an  impact  assessment  of  relevant  commodities  on  deforestation  and 
 forest   
degradation. The first review of the commodity scope is to take place within two  
years of the   
entry into force of the Regulation.

2.2.     What about listed products that do not contain listed commodities?  
(UPDATED)   

                                                                              … not  
made              of          a   
                                        …   made     of   the commodity commodity  
listed                in     the   
                                        listed   in   the   corresponding  
corresponding  left  column  of   
                                        left column of Annex I                Annex  
I   

Relevant         product         listed Subject     to   the    Regulation   
﻿                                                                              Not  
subject to the Regulation    
in Annex I…                             (EUDR)   

Other            product not listed   
                                        Not subject to the Regulation   Not subject  
to the Regulation    
in Annex I…   

Products included in Annex I that do not contain, or are not made of, the  
commodities listed   
in the corresponding left column of Annex I are not covered by the Regulation.    

“ex” before the HS code of products in Annex I means that the product described in  
the annex   
is an “extract” from all the products that can be classified under the HS code. For  
instance,   
code 9401 might  include  seats made  of  raw  materials other than wood, but only  
wooden   
seats are subject to the requirements of the Regulation. Similarly, HS 0201 covers  
“Meat of   
bovine  animals, fresh or chilled”, whereas ex 0201 in Annex I of the Regulation  
covers only   
“Meat of cattle, fresh or chilled”, meaning cattle of the genus  Bos and it’s  
sub-generas: Bos,   
Bibos, Novibos and Poephagus, but bison (Bison genus) or buffalo (Syncerus genus)  
meat are   
not covered by the Regulation.    

In case the relevant product, e.g. “ex 4011 New pneumatic tyres  of rubber” is made  
from a   
mix of synthetic and natural rubber then the operator (or non-SME trader) has to   
exercise   
due diligence only for the natural rubber ingredient.   

2.3.     Does the Regulation apply regardless of quantity or value?   

There is no threshold volume or value of a relevant commodity or relevant product,  
including   
within processed products, below which the Regulation would not apply.   

Operators and traders placing or making available on the  EU market or exporting a  
relevant   
product  included  in  Annex  I,  whatever  its  quantity,  are  subject  to  the   
obligations  of  the   
Regulation.   

2.4.     What about commodities produced in the EU? (UPDATED)   

Commodities produced inside the EU are subject to the same requirements as  
﻿commodities   
produced outside the EU. The Regulation applies to products listed in Annex I,  
whether they   
are produced or manufactured in the EU or imported.   

For  instance,  if  an  EU  company  manufactures  chocolate  (code  1806,  which   
is  included  in   
Annex I), then it will be considered as a  downstream  operator subject to the  
obligations of   
the Regulation, even if the cocoa powder used in the chocolate has already been  
placed on   

                                                        25   
   
    

the  EU  market and fulfilled the due diligence requirements (see also  FAQ 3.4. and 
3.5.  on   
downstream operators).    

2.5.      How does the Regulation apply to wood and paper used for packaging?  
(UPDATED)   

For example, in the case of a producer selling packaging, such as pallets, to  
manufacturers (to   
protect  the  final  product  -  not  to  be  sold  as  a  final  product  to   
consumers),  the  text  "not   
including packaging material used exclusively as packaging material to support,  
protect or   
carry another product placed on the market" in Annex I should be understood as  
follows:   

If any of the concerned packaging is placed on the EU market or exported as a  
product in its   
own  right  (i.e.  standalone  packaging),  rather  than  as  packaging  for   
another  product,  it  is   
covered by the Regulation and therefore due diligence requirements apply.   

If packaging, as classified under HS code 4415 or another HS Code, for example HS  
48, is used   
to ‘support, protect or carry’ another product, it is not covered by the Regulation. 
   

Packaging  materials  used  exclusively  as  packaging  material  to  support,   
protect  or  carry   
another product placed on the  EU  market is not a relevant product within the  
meaning of   
Annex  I  of  the  Regulation,  regardless  of  the  HS  code  under  which  they   
fall.  Whether  the   
packaging material  is listed on the  invoice  alongside  the  carried product  is  
﻿irrelevant;  it  is   
rather  decisive whether the packaging would be classified jointly or separately in  
an import   
or export scenario  (see rule 5b) of the General rules for the interpretation of the 
Combined   
Nomenclature).   According   to   the   rule   5b),   packing   materials   and    
packing   containers   
presented  with  the  goods  therein  shall  be  classified  with  the  goods  if   
they  are  of  a  kind   
normally used for packing such goods. Where packaging is or would be classified  
jointly with   
the  carried  product,  it  can  be  considered  to  be  used  exclusively  as   
packaging  material  to   
support,  protect  or  carry  another  product  placed  or  made  available  on  the 
 EU  market  or   
exported from it.   

In a draft Delegated Act put forward by the Commission, it is proposed that  user  
manuals,   
information leaflets, catalogues,  marketing materials  as well as labels   
accompanying  other   
products are also falling under this exemption unless they are  placed or made  
available on   
the market or exported in their own right.   

2.6.     Would the return of a relevant empty packaging by the retailer to its  
supplier be   
  considered  ‘making  available  on  the  EU  market’  when  the  concerned   
packaging  was   
  placed on the EU market in its own right (i.e. standalone packaging) prior to the  
return?   
  (UPDATED)   

As  long  as  the  concerned  packaging,  such  as  for  example  a  pallet,  is   
placed  on  or  made   
available on the market or exported as a product in its own right (i.e. standalone  
packaging),   
rather than as packaging for another product, it is covered by the Regulation and  
therefore   
the relevant due diligence requirements apply (see Q. above). This should apply as  
long as the   
concerned packaging is used for commercial purposes in its own right.    

However, once the concerned packaging becomes a packaging material used exclusively  
as   
packaging material to support, protect or carry a product, it is then not covered by 
the scope   

                                                         26   
   
﻿    

of  the  Regulation.  This  means  that  selling  or  renting  used  packaging   
material  to  other   
companies is not subject to EUDR. Similarly, empty  packaging material already used  
for the   
first  time  to  support,  protect  or  carry  another  product,  for  instance   
when  traded within  a   
closed loop exchange system (i.e., pallets are transferred from one company to  
another to be   
reused for transport) is not covered by the Regulation. For additional information  
on renting   
of products, see FAQ 2.14.   

If  packaging  that  has  already  been  used  to  support,  protect  or  carry   
another  product  is   
repaired and sold, it  must comply with EUDR regarding only new  relevant products   
used for   
the repair (e.g. a pallet that is repaired with non-recycled wood components). This  
means that,   
in  the  example,  a  new  DDS  must  be  submitted  for  the  pallet,  but  only   
the  new  wood   
components are subject to the due diligence exercise.   

2.7.      Does trading with relevant second-hand products on the EU market fall in  
the scope   
   of the Regulation?    

Second-hand products which have completed their lifecycle and would be otherwise  
disposed   
of as waste (see Recital 40 and Annex I) are not subject to the obligations of this  
Regulation.   

2.8.      Does recycled paper/paperboard fall under the scope of the Regulation?   

Most recycled paper/paperboard products contain a small percentage of virgin pulp or 
pre-  
consumed  recycled  paper  (for  example,  discarded  paperboard  scraps  from   
cardboard box   
production) to strengthen the fibres.   

Annex I states that the Regulation does not apply to goods if they are produced  
entirely from   
material  that  has  completed  its  lifecycle  and  would  otherwise  have  been   
discarded  as   
waste as defined in Art. 3, point (1), of Directive 2008/98/EC. So, no obligations  
apply  under   
the regulation to the recycled material.    

On  the  contrary, if  the  product  contains  non-recycled  material,  then  it  is 
﻿ subject  to  the   
requirements of the Regulation and the non-recycled material will need to be traced  
back to   
the plot of origin via geolocation.   

Annex I also clarifies that generally, by-products of a manufacturing process are  
subject to the   
Regulation. In the case of paper/paperboard which constitutes a recovered (waste and 
scrap)   
product,  such  paper  and  paperboard  is  exempt  from  the  scope  according  to  
Annex  I  (see   
Chapter 47 and 48 of the Combined Nomenclature).   

2.8.1     Are tyre casings or carcasses of retreaded tyres subject to the  
Regulation? (NEW)   

In a draft Delegated Act put forward by the Commission, it is proposed that used  
tyre casings   
and carcasses (generally used for retreading tyres) are out of the scope of the  
Regulation,   
whereas retreaded tyres are in the scope only for the new natural rubber  parts,  
such as the   
tread, applied to the carcasses and casings.   

                                                         27   
   
    

2.9.      What are CN and HS Codes and how should they be used?  Where can I find  
more   
  information about applicable TARIC measures? (UPDATED)   

The nomenclature governed by the Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description  

and    Coding      System,     commonly        known      as "HS     Nomenclature",  
       is   an   international   
multipurpose nomenclature which was elaborated under the auspices of the World  
Customs   
Organization (WCO). This nomenclature assigns six-digit codes to classify goods and  
applies   
worldwide.  Countries/regions  can  add  additional  numbers  to  the  universal   
six-digit  HS   
Nomenclature for more detailed classification.   

The Combined Nomenclature (CN code) of the European Union is an eight-digit  
commodity   
code that further subdivides the global HS Nomenclature into more specific goods to  
address   
the needs of the European Community.   
﻿The  CN  code  is  the  basis  for  the  declaration  of  goods  for  import  into   
or  export  from  the   
European Union, and also for intra-EU trade statistics. Commodities and products in  
Annex I   
of  the  Regulation  are  classified  by  their  CN  codes.  Relevant  products  in  
Annex  I  of  the   
Regulation are classified in the Combined Nomenclature set out in Annex I to  
Regulation (EEC)   
No 2658/87.   

At  import,  when  releasing  goods  for  free  circulation  as  defined  in  Art.   
201  of  the  UCC   
Regulation (EU) No 952/2013, the CN code can be further subdivided to a ten-digit  
TARIC code   
specifically  created  to  address  the  needs  of  the  EU  legislation.  When   
declaring  goods  for   
export procedure as defined in Art.  269 of the UCC Regulation (EU) No 952/2013, the 
final   
subdivision can go up to an eight-digit CN code.   

Supply  chain  members  need  to  classify  their  products  based  on  Annex  I  to 
 the  basic  CN   
Regulation (Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical  
nomenclature   
and on the Common Customs Tariff) to establish whether the Regulation applies to  
them. The   
HS codes can evolve every 5 years. The EU’s CN Regulation is adopted each year, to  
reflect   
any updates.   

See for more information: Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the 
tariff   
and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff.

2.10.    When  is  there  a  “supply”  of  a  relevant  product,  meaning  it  is   
placed  or  made   
  available  on  the  market  in  the  course  of  a  commercial  activity?  To   
what  extent  are   
  companies in  scope when  they  use  relevant  products in their own business or  
process   
  them? (UPDATED)   

A  distinction  has  to  be  made  between  the  person  in  the  supply  chain   
which  imports  or   
domestically places a relevant product on the EU market and persons further down the 
supply   
chain:   

If a person places on the EU market a relevant product manufactured or produced in  
the EU,   
it is thereby supplying the product on the market for the first time. A supply  
presupposes an   
agreement (written or verbal) between two or more legal or natural persons for the  
transfer   
of ownership or any other property right concerning the product in question; it  
requires that   
the product has been manufactured or that the commodity, if placed on the market  
without   
manufacturing, has been produced (see Art. 2(14) EUDR). Such an activity is relevant 
under   
the EUDR, no matter if the relevant product is placed on the market for a) the  
purpose of   
processing,  b)  distribution  to  commercial  or  non-commercial  consumers  or  c) 
 use  in  the   
business of the operator itself (see Art. 2(19) EUDR). The company is an operator  
and needs   
to exercise due diligence and submit a DDS.    

If a relevant product is to be placed under customs procedure “release for free  
circulation”   
in   the   course   of   a   commercial   activity   and   not   intended   for    
private   use   or   private   
consumption,  it  is  assumed  to  be  intended  to  be  placed  on  the  market,   
irrespective  of  a   
“supply” or irrespective of an agreement (written or verbal) between two or more  
legal or   
natural persons for the transfer of ownership or an equivalent right concerning the  
product   
in question.   

After a product has been placed on the market, it is “supplied” on the market for  
﻿distribution,   
consumption or use if there is an agreement between two or more legal or natural  
persons   
for a transfer of ownership or an equivalent concerning the product in question  
(e.g. a sale or   
a gift agreement) after the stage of manufacture (and production in the case of  
commodities)   
has  taken  place.  The  EUDR  does  generally  not  establish  obligations  on   
those  who  offer   
logistical services along the supply chain (e.g. shipping agents/transport agents or 
customs   
representatives are not ‘operators’ or ‘traders in the meaning of the EUDR) as far  
as they do   
not place products on the market or export.   

These situations may be explained by a few examples:    

     1)   Car  company  B  buys  leather  of  cattle  (relevant  product)  from  EU  
tannery  T  to   
          manufacture a car using the leather of cattle for the car seats. Car  
company B places   
         the  car  (non-relevant  product)  on  the  market  by  selling  it  to   
end  consumers.  Car   
         company B is not an operator, as the car it is supplying on the market is  
not a relevant   
          product in Annex I, nor a trader, as it is not supplying the leather of  
cattle (individually)   
         - on the market.   
     2)   Car  company  B  imports  (i.e.,  place  under  customs  procedure   
“release  for  free   
         circulation”) leather of cattle to manufacture cars. Car company B is an  
operator when   

                                                         29   
   
    

         importing leather for its own business operations. B needs to exercise due  
diligence   
         and submit a DDS prior to the release for free circulation.   
     3)   Farmer D buys soya bean meal (relevant product) from a crushing company  
inside the   
         EU market and feeds it to his chicken (non-relevant product) which he then  
sells. D is   
         not an operator  when  selling  the  chicken,  as  chicken are not a  
relevant product in   
         Annex  I,  nor  a  trader,  as  he  is  not  supplying  the  soya  bean   
meal  on  the  market.   
         However, D would be an operator if he imported (i.e. placed under customs  
procedure   
﻿         “release for free circulation”) the soya bean meal to feed to the chicken  
(see above   
         scenario 2).   
         In  case  the  farmer  feeds  soya  relevant  products  to  cattle   
(relevant  product)  please   
         refer to Recital 39.   
     4)   Printing  company  P  buys  paper  from  paper  manufacturer  B  and   
prints  various   
         products which are then supplied to publisher C. P is an operator when  
selling printed   
         paper  products  (relevant  product)  to  publisher  C.  On  the  other   
hand,  if  printing   
         company P merely offers  printing services without ever owning the printed  
products,   
         it does not supply  printed  paper products itself, meaning in this case,   
P  is a  service   
         provider without obligations under the EUDR.   

In the examples below, the persons process or use relevant products in their  
business. They   
are only subject to the Regulation in those cases in which they are supplying  
relevant products   
on the market:    

     5)   Company  A  buys  from  retailer  B  in  a  third  country  and  imports   
(i.e.,  places  under   
         customs procedure “release for free circulation”) wooden tables and seats  
(relevant   
         products). The furniture will be used by A’s own employees during working  
hours. A is   
         an operator and needs to exercise due diligence and submit a DDS prior to  
the release   
         for free circulation of the wooden tables and seats.   
     6)   Company D buys wooden tables and seats (relevant products) from EU  
operator B who   
         has imported them from a third country and who has already carried out due  
diligence   
         and submitted a DDS. Company D will use the furniture for its own employees 
during   
         working hours. The furniture is not supplied, hence D is not subject to the 
EUDR.   
     7)   EU-established farmer F harvests his own soy beans (relevant products) and 
processes   
         the soy beans into soy flour (relevant product) which is used to feed his  
chicken at his   
         own farm. As farmer F is not supplying the soy beans and soy flour on the  
market (for   
         example, to another legal or natural person), they are not placed on the  
market and F   
         is not subject to the EUDR.   
﻿     8)   EU-established farmer F harvests his own soy beans (relevant products) and 
processes   
         them  into  soy  flour  (relevant  product)  which  he  sells  to   
EU-established  farmer  G.   
         Farmer F is an operator with regard to the soy flour, as it is being  
supplied to farmer   
         G.   
     9)   EU-established company B harvests its own forest and processes the logs  
into wood   
         chips (relevant product) from the logs (relevant product). It uses the wood 
chips as   
         fuel for heating its own facilities. As B is not supplying the logs or wood 
chips on the   
         market, there is no placing or making available on the market and B is not  
subject to   
         the EUDR.   

                                                         30   
   
    

     10) Company C buys wood chips (relevant product) from an EU operator who has  
already   
         carried out due diligence and submitted a DDS. Company C uses the wood  
chips as   
         fuel for heating their own facilities. As C is not supplying the logs or  
wood chips on the   
          market, there is no placing or making available on the market and C is not 
subject to   
         the EUDR.   
     11) Company C buys wood chips (relevant product) from an EU operator who has  
already   
         carried out due diligence and submitted a DDS. Company C uses the wood  
chips to   
          produce electricity. As C is not placing or making available a relevant  
product on the   
          market, C is not subject to the EUDR.   

2.11.    When is there a need to exercise due diligence and submit a DDS if the same 
natural   
  or  legal  person  processes  a  relevant  product  multiple  times  in  the   
course  of  their   
  commercial activity?   

In case of multiple occasions of internal processing (relevant product X is being  
processed into   
relevant  product  Y  and  subsequently  into  relevant  product  Z  by  the  same   
company),   
obligations arise only for the placing on the market of the last relevant product  
(product Z).   
﻿This can be demonstrated by the following example:   

Non-SME chocolate company C buys cocoa beans (relevant product) from EU operator I  
and   
processes   them   into   cocoa   powder   (relevant   product)   and   subsequently 
  into   food   
preparations   containing   cocoa   (relevant   product).   Company   C   then    
places   the   food   
preparations on the market by selling them to company D. In this case, obligations  
apply only   
for  the  food  preparations,  so  company  C  needs  to  ascertain  the  compliance 
 of  the  due   
diligence and submit a DDS prior to placing them on the market.    

If company C was an SME, it would not be required to exercise due diligence or  
submit a DDS   
for food preparations, provided that operator I already exercised due diligence for  
the cocoa   
beans  contained  in  the  processed  products  (see  Art.  4(8) EUDR).  In  that   
case,  company  C   
would only be required to retain the due diligence reference number obtained from  
operator   
I.    

2.12.     Is bamboo in scope of the EUDR? What about other products that do not  
contain or   
  have been made using relevant commodities, but that are listed in Annex I?   

Products made solely from bamboo are not in scope of the EUDR. Art.  1(1) EUDR  
defines that   
for the EUDR the ‘relevant products’ are only those that contain or are made from  
relevant   
commodities, amongst them ‘wood’. The definition in Art. 2(2) EUDR also clarifies  
that for the   
purposes  of the  EUDR  the  HS  codes  listed  in  Annex  I  are  only  pertinent   
to  identify which   
products are captured by the EUDR.    

In  accordance  with  the  FAO  explanatory  notes,  bamboo  is  a  non-wood  forest 
 product,   
consequentially bamboo does not fall under the commodity wood.   

                                                         31   
   
    

2.13.    Are exchanges of written letters and other items of correspondence subject  
to EUDR   
  requirements? (NEW)   
﻿According  to  Art.  1(26)  and  141(2)  of  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  2015/2446  
to  the  Union   
Customs   Code,   “items   of   correspondence”   are   not   subject   to   customs 
  declarations   
requirements and thus to the presentation of a DDS reference number. Similarly,  
within the   
EU, such items of correspondence are not placed or made available on the market but  
serve   
a  communication  purpose.  It  is  to  be  noted  that  relevant  products   
contained  in  items  of   
correspondence (e.g. in an envelope) cannot be considered as ‘items of  
correspondence’ and   
therefore,  where  applicable,  are  subject  to  customs  declaration  requirements 
 and  to  the   
presentation of a DDS reference number.   

2.14.    Are  samples  and  products  used  for  examination,  analysis  or  testing 
 purposes  in   
  scope of the EUDR? (NEW)   

In  a  draft  Delegated  Act  put  forward  by  the  Commission,  it  is  proposed   
that  samples  of   
products, which are of negligible value and quantity and can be consumed or used  
only to   
solicit orders for goods of the type they represent under the condition that the  
manner of   
presentation and quantity, for products of the same type or quality, rule out its  
consumption   
or use for any purpose other than that of seeking orders, are not in scope of the  
Regulation.   
The  same  applies  to  products  which  are  to  undergo  examination,  analysis   
or  tests  to   
determine  their  composition,  quality  or  other  technical  characteristics  for  
purposes  of   
information or industrial or commercial research under the condition that the  
products to be   
analysed,  examined  or  tested  are  completely  used  up  or  destroyed  in  the   
course  of  the   
examination, analysis or testing.   

Examples  of  supplies  of  samples  and  products  used  for  examination,   
analysis  or  testing   
purposes include:     

     •   A supplier sending tyres to a vehicle manufacturer for the recipient to  
test its quality   
         and durability – the tyres will be destroyed in the course of testing.    
     •   A supplier sending small quantities of a new ingredient (e.g. cocoa or  
coffee beans) to   
         a food manufacturer for the purpose of sensory evaluation, and to test its  
﻿quality and   
         food safety within the business. The ingredient is completely used up in  
the course of   
         analysis and testing. In this case, the supplier and the food manufacturer  
are out of   
         scope if the ingredient is clearly intended to be used for analysis and  
testing purposes   
         given the contractual arrangements and surrounding circumstances.     
     •   A  coffee  company  importing  a  small  sample  of  coffee  beans  from  a 
 new  area  of   
         production to use and consume them in their business in order to decide  
whether to   
         order a large amount of coffee beans from the same area.   

2.15.    Does the Regulation cover the renting out of relevant products? (NEW)   

If a relevant product is rented out, or provided under a similar contractual  
arrangement, the   
product is not considered to be placed or made available on the market. A supply  
under the   
EUDR presupposes an agreement (written or verbal) between two or more legal or  
natural   
persons for the transfer of ownership or any other property right concerning the  
product in   

                                                         32   
   
    

question  (see  FAQ  2.10.).  However,  as  specified  in  paragraph  3  of  FAQ   
2.10,  any  product   
released  for  free  circulation  on  the  EU  market  or  placed  under  the   
customs  procedure   
‘export’,  incl.  where  rented  out,  is  considered  as  being  placed  on  the   
market  and  is  thus   
subject to the Regulation).    

Example: non-SME  EU company P buys wooden articles of furniture  (relevant product) 
from   
EU manufacturer S who has carried out due diligence and submitted a DDS for the  
furniture.   
The furniture is rented out by P within the EU to be used over a certain period of  
time before   
being returned to P for subsequent renting out. P is not subject to the obligations  
of the EUDR,   
as it is only renting out the furniture, and is not transferring ownership or  
another property   
right.

3.        Subjects of obligations   

3.1.      Who is considered an operator? (UPDATED)   

As defined in Art. 2(15) of the Regulation, an operator is a natural or legal person 
who places   
relevant products on the EU market (including  by importing them) or exports them  
from the   
EU in the course of a commercial activity.   

This  definition  also  covers  companies  that  transform  one  product  of  Annex  
I  (which  has   
already  been  the  object  of  due  diligence)  into  another  product  of  Annex   
I,  where  such   
transformation corresponds to a change of HS Code (see FAQ 3.1.1). For example, if  
company   
A, based in the EU, imports cocoa butter (HS code 1804, included in Annex I), and  
company   
B, also based in the EU, uses that cocoa butter to produce chocolate (HS code 1806,  
included   
in  Annex  I)  and  places  it  on  the  EU  market,  both  company  A  and  B   
would  be  considered   
operators under the  regulation.  Company A would be considered the “upstream  
operator”,   
whereas company B would be a “downstream operator”. Operators placing on the EU  
market   
products  listed in Annex I that have  not been subject to due diligence in a prior  
step of the   
supply chain (for example importers sourcing cocoa) are, regardless of their size,  
subject to   
the obligation of submitting a due diligence statement.   

3.1.1. To what extent does a change of HS code have an impact on the designation of  
the   
company as an operator or a trader? (NEW)    

A change in the Commodity Code (HS, CN or TARIC) of a product already placed on the  
market   
results in a company placing a derived product on the market being an operator only  
if the   
change affects the digits that are listed in Annex I. For example, company A, based  
in the EU,   
imports  unroasted  coffee  (HS  Code  0901  11), which falls under  HS  Code  0901  
as  listed  in   
Annex I. Company B, also based in the EU, subsequently roasts the coffee beans (HS  
Code   
0901 21), which remains under HS Code 0901 in Annex I. In the given example, company 
﻿A   
would be considered an operator under the Regulation, while company B would be  
classified   
as a trader. This is because the HS code for roasted coffee starts with the same  
four digits as   
the HS code for unroasted coffee beans, and only these first four digits are listed  
in Annex I   

                                                          33   
   
    

of the EUDR.  In the case of HS 47, 48, and 49, the same principle applies for the  
first two digits   
of HS codes.   

3.2.     What does “in the course of commercial activity” mean?   

Commercial activity is understood as an activity taking place in a business-related  
context.   

The  combined definitions  of  “operator”  (Art.  2(15)) and of ‘in the  course  of  
a  commercial   
activity’ (Art.  2(19)) in the Regulation imply that any  person, who  places a  
relevant product   
on the  EU  market for selling (with or without transformation) or as a free sample, 
 for the   
purpose of processing or for distribution to commercial or non-commercial consumers, 
or for   
use  in  the  context  of  its  commercial  activities,   will  be  subject  to  the 
 due  diligence   
requirements and have to submit a due diligence statement.   

3.3.     What does ‘relevant legislation of the country of production’ mean?  
(UPDATED)   

Relevant commodities and products can only be placed on the EU market if they comply 
with   
the three requirements  of Art.  3  of the Regulation, namely  (1)  they  are  
deforestation-free   
(Art. 3(a)),  (2) comply with the relevant legislation of the country of production  
(Art. 3(b)),   
and (3) are covered by a due diligence statement (Art.3(c)).   

‘Relevant legislation’ may include, among others, national laws (including relevant  
secondary   
law)  and international law as applicable in domestic law. ‘Country of production’   
means the   
country  in  which  a  relevant  commodity  was  produced  (see  Art.  2(24)  EUDR). 
 ‘Produced’   
﻿means grown, harvested,  obtained from  or  raised  on  relevant plots of land or,   
as regards   
cattle, on establishments (see Art. 2(14) EUDR). Consequentially, legislation of  
other countries   
in which further steps of a manufacturing process may have taken place are not  
relevant for   
the  legality  requirement   (for  instance,  soy  beans  harvested  in  country  A  
(country  of   
production) being manufactured into soymeal in country B prior to being placed on  
the EU   
market in country  C). The  Regulation  provides  a  list of legislative  areas   
without  specifying   
particular  legal  acts,  as  these  differ  from  country  to  country  and  may   
be  subject  to   
amendments. According to the definition, the legislation listed in Art.  2(40)  
letters (a) to (h)   
must  be  interpreted  as  being  concerned  with  the  legal  status  of  the  area 
 of  production.   
Additionally, for the different fields of legislation, the meaning and purpose  
stipulated in Art.   
1(1)(a) and (b) EUDR should be taken into account. Therefore, among others,  
legislation with   
a link to the protection of forests, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions or  
the protection   
of biodiversity is relevant.   

Relevant documentation is required for the purposes of the risk assessment  pursuant 
to Art.   
9(1)(h)  and  10 of the  Regulation. Such documentation may, for example, consist of 
official   
documents  from  public  authorities,  contractual  agreements,  court  decisions   
or  impact   
assessments and audits which may have been  carried out. In any case, the operator  
has to   
verify  that  these  documents  are  verifiable  and  reliable,  taking  into   
account  the  risk  of   
corruption in the country of production.    

Further     information      can    be   found     in   the   Commission         
Notice    Guidance      document   
(C/2024/6789).

3.4.     What are the obligations of downstream non-SME operators and non-SME  
traders?   
  (UPDATED)   
﻿Downstream operators are those who place on the market or export relevant products  
listed   
in Annex I whose components or ingredients (all of them) have previously been  
subject to due   
diligence under EUDR and have been the object of a due diligence statement  
submission. For   
example, a furniture manufacturer that sells wooden furniture made of wood that has  
already   
been  subject  to  EUDR  obligations  would  be  considered  a  downstream   
operator.  Their   
obligations vary depending on whether they are Small and Medium-sized Enterprises  
(SMEs)   
or not (for obligations of downstream SME operators, see FAQ 3.5).    

Non-SME  traders  are  large  companies  that  make  relevant  products  available   
on  the  EU   
market.  For  example,  a  large  supermarket  chain  selling  to  consumers   
chocolate  that  has   
already been placed on the EU market by another company would be a non-SME trader  
under   
the Regulation. They are subject to the same rules as downstream non-SME operators,  
see   
Art. 5(1) EUDR and FAQ 3.8.  Pursuant to Art. 4(9) EUDR, when submitting their due  
diligence   
statement in the Information System, downstream non-SME operators - and non-SME  
traders   
-  may refer to due diligence performed earlier in the supply chain by including the 
relevant   
reference number for the parts of their relevant products that were already subject  
to a due   
diligence.    

Key Obligations:    

Downstream non-SME operators and non-SME traders are required to:    

     1.   Ascertain that due diligence was exercised upstream in the supply chain   
pursuant to   
         Art. 4(9) EUDR; for this purpose, they can review the information in the  
Information   
         System (see details below).    

     2.   Submit  a  due  diligence  statement  (DDS)  and  refer  to  previous  DDS 
 by  including   
                                                                                3  
          relevant  reference  numbers  and  verification  numbers   received  from  
their  direct   
         suppliers.    

According to Art. 12 EUDR, downstream non-SME operators and non-SME traders are  
﻿under   
the obligation to establish and keep up to date a due diligence system to ascertain  
that due   
diligence has been exercised upstream.   

Ascertaining that due diligence has been exercised   

Downstream  non-SME  operators  and  non-SME  traders  ascertain  that  due   
diligence  was   
exercised upstream by  collecting the reference numbers and verification numbers  of 
DDS   
submitted upstream and verifying the validity of the reference numbers . Downstream  
non-  
SME operators and non-SME traders then  submit their own DDS, referencing all  
previous   
DDS received from their direct suppliers. (N.B.: The Information System referred to  
in Art. 33   
EUDR automatically verifies the validity of up to 2,000 DDS reference numbers at  
once when   

                                        
3 ‘Verification number’, defined in Art.3(f) of Implementing Regulation (EU)  
2024/3084, means a security number   

assigned by the Information System to the Due Diligence Statement submitted by the  
Information System user   
to ensure additional security of data contained in the Due Diligence Statement.   

                                                         35   
   
    

submitting  a  new  DDS,  so  this  obligation  does  not  entail  any  additional   
administrative   
burden.)   

Possible further steps   

Given  that  in  accordance  with  Art.  4(10)  EUDR,  non-SME  operators  and   
non-SME  traders   
retain legal responsibility in the event of a breach of the Regulation, they could,  
based on the   
risks and particularities of their supply chains, choose to take further steps when  
ascertaining   
that due diligence has been carried out.   

For example, non-SME operators and  non-SME traders could check the chain of  
submitted   
DDS as well as the information provided in previous DDS regarding country of  
production,   
﻿quantity and HS codes of declared products and – where available – geolocation and  
scientific   
names, in order to verify the  completeness and plausibility of the information  
provided  in   
light  of  the  products  they  intend  to  place  or  make  available  on the  EU   
market  or  export.   
Ascertaining   that   due   diligence   was   properly   carried   out   does   not  
 imply   having   to   
systematically check every single due diligence statement submitted by upstream  
suppliers.   

Downstream non-SME operators or non-SME traders may also wish to collect and analyse 
  
information  beyond  what  is  contained  in  the  Information  System.  Downstream  
non-SME   
operators or  non-SME traders may,  for instance,  use  the  list of countries or   
parts thereof   
referred to in Art. 29(2) EUDR; consult the publicly available reports based on Art. 
12(3) EUDR   
from  non-SME  upstream suppliers; consult the results of an audit conducted based  
on Art.   
11(2)(b) EUDR; or request, on a voluntary basis, further information from their  
suppliers. In   
that  manner,  they  could  verify  that  their  direct  suppliers,  where  these   
are  non-SMEs  or   
upstream  operators,  have  an  operational  and  up-to-date  due  diligence  system 
 in  place,   
including  adequate  and  proportionate  policies,  controls,  and  procedures  to   
mitigate  and   
manage  effectively  the  risks  of  non-compliance  of  relevant  products,  to   
ensure  that  due   
diligence is properly and regularly exercised.   

Direct or indirect supply by SMEs   

SME traders and downstream SME operators are not obliged to collect information  
related to   
the due diligence exercise and hence are not under a legal obligation to communicate 
to their   
clients any information beyond the reference number and verification number   
pursuant to   
Art. 4(7) EUDR. This, in consequence, limits the available information that must be  
collected,   
analysed and communicated by non-SME operators and non-SME traders which are  
supplied   
directly or indirectly by SMEs.   

The  measures  taken  by  operators  and  traders  when  communicating  information  
and   
ascertaining that due diligence was exercised should be taken into account by the  
﻿competent   
authorities in their risk analyses.    

If  downstream  non-SME  operators  and  non-SME  traders  come  to  the  conclusion 
 that   
products may be non-compliant or that there is a non-negligible risk of  
non-compliance, they   
must refrain from placing or making relevant products available on the market or  
exporting   
them. If downstream operators or traders obtain or are made aware of information  
pointing   

                                                         36   
   
    

to non-compliance, they must immediately inform the competent authorities in  
accordance   
with Art. 4(5) and 5(5) EUDR.   

No requirement to collect information   

As downstream non-SME operators and non-SME traders who only have to ascertain that  
due   
diligence was exercised, they do not have to collect information required by Art. 9  
EUDR.   
DDS  include  a  declaration  that  due diligence  was exercised, implying that the  
information   
required by Art. 9 EUDR has been collected by the upstream operator (see point 5 in  
Annex   
II).   

Parts of products not yet subject to due diligence   

For parts of relevant products that have not been subject to due diligence, non-SME  
operators   
should exercise due diligence in full and submit a due diligence statement.   
    
3.5.      What  are  the  obligations  of  SME  operators  further  down  the   
supply  chain?   
  (UPDATED)   

Operators further down the supply chain are those who either transform a product  
listed in   
Annex I (which has already been subjected to due diligence) into another product  
listed in   
Annex  I  or  export  a  product  listed  in  Annex  I  (which  has  already  been   
subjected  to  due   
diligence).    
﻿SME  operators  further  down  the  supply  chain  retain  legal  responsibility  in 
 the  event  of  a   
breach  of  the  Regulation.  They  are  required  to  obtain  due  diligence   
statement  reference   
numbers  and  verification  numbers  associated  to  products  and  make  them   
available  to   
competent  authorities  upon  request,  as  well  as  to  make  them  available  to  
operators  and   
traders to whom they supply the relevant products . Furthermore, they have to   
immediately   
inform competent  authorities  if they  find  a  risk  of non-compliance and offer   
all necessary   
assistance to facilitate checks (Art. 4(4)(a), (5)  -  (8) EUDR).  However, in  
respect of parts of   
their  products  that  have  been  subject  to  a  due  diligence,  they  are   
neither  required  to  a)   
exercise due diligence for parts of their products that were already subject of due  
diligence   
exercise;  nor  to  b)  submit  a  due  diligence  statement  in  the  Information   
System  (Art.  4(8)   
EUDR). But they still have to provide due diligence reference numbers obtained from  
previous   
steps in the supply chain upon request of the competent authorities as well as, in  
case of re-  
import or export, in the customs declaration for release for free circulation or  
export (Art.   
26(4) EUDR).   

For parts of relevant products that have not been subject to due diligence, SME  
operators   
should exercise due diligence in full and submit a due diligence statement.   

3.6.      Will operators and  non-SME traders further down the supply chain have  
access,  in   
  the   Information   System,   to   geolocation   information   in   due    
diligence   statements   
  submitted by upstream operators to the Information System? (UPDATED)   

Upstream operators will be able to decide whether the geolocation information  
contained in   
their due diligence statements  submitted in the Information System  will be  
accessible and   
visible  for  downstream  operators  and  non-SME  traders  via  the  referenced   
due  diligence   

                                                           37   
   
    

statements   inside   the   Information   System.  Even   if   the   geolocation    
﻿is   not   visible   for   
downstream  operators  and  traders,  it  is  contained  in  their  due  diligence   
statements  (as   
required  by  point  3  in  Annex  II)   by  referencing  the  upstream  statements. 
  For  further   
information on visibility of the geolocation information, see FAQ 7.7.    
   
3.7.      What happens if a non-EU based operator places a relevant product or  
commodity   
  on the EU market? Under which circumstances will non-EU based operators have  
access   
  to the Information System? (UPDATED)   

If a natural or legal person established outside the EU places relevant products on  
the market,   
according to Art. 7 EUDR the first person established in the Union who makes such  
products   
available on the market is deemed to be an operator within the meaning of the  
Regulation.    

This means that in this case, there will be two operators within the meaning of the  
Regulation   
– one established outside and one inside of the EU.    
   
The first person established in the Union that is deemed to be an operator   
according to Art.   
7  EUDR  is  subject  to  the  obligations  of  “upstream  operators”  (see  FAQ   
3.1.  for  more   
information). Art. 4(8) and Art. 4(9) EUDR do not apply to the first person  
established in the   
Union; the purpose of Art. 7 EUDR, as set out in Recital 30, is that in every supply 
chain in the   
Union there is an operator who is established in the Union and can be held  
accountable in the   
event of non-fulfilment of the obligations under the EUDR.   
   
Example:   
Non-EU based company A imports and releases for free circulation cocoa beans, a  
relevant   
product. Company A supplies the cocoa beans to EU-based company B.   
Company A is a non-EU based operator and must exercise due diligence and submit a  
DDS   
into the Information System. As a consequence of Art. 7 EUDR, EU-based company B  is 
an   
operator and is equally obliged to exercise due diligence and submit a DDS.    
   
Non-EU based operators will only have access to the Information System if they have  
a valid   
EORI number issued by an EU Member State or by the United Kingdom in respect of  
Northern   
﻿Ireland (XI), as only in this case they will need to submit a due diligence  
statement after having   
conducted due diligence prior to lodging a customs declaration. They will have  
access to the   
system in the role of an operator and not as an authorised representative, as  
according to Art.   
2(22) of the Regulation, the authorised representative must be established in the  
Union.    
   
3.8.      Which companies are non-SME traders and what are their obligations?   

A non-SME trader is a trader which is not a small and medium-sized undertaking  
pursuant to   
Art.  2(30)  of  the  Regulation.  This  provision  refers  to  the  definitions   
provided  in  Art.  3  of   
Directive 2013/34/EU.   

This will essentially include any large company that is not an operator and  
commercialises -   
the products included in Annex  I  on the  EU market, for instance, large  
supermarket or retail   
chains.   

                                                             38   
   
    

By virtue of Art.  5(1) of the  Regulation, the obligations of  non-SME traders are  
the same as   
those of large downstream operators: a) they need to  submit  a due diligence  
statement; b)   
when doing so, they may rely on due diligence previously carried out in the supply  
chain but,   
in such a case, they are subject to the provisions of Art.  4(9)  ; c) they are  
liable in case of   
breach of the Regulation, including for due diligence carried out or a due diligence 
statement   
submitted by an upstream operator.   

3.9.     Are organizations that are not SMEs and sell to consumers (retailers)  
classified as   
  traders?    

A retailer organisation can either qualify as an ‘operator’ (if it qualifies as  
‘natural or legal   
person who, in the course of a commercial activity, places relevant products on the  
EU market   
or exports them’) or as ‘trader’ (if it qualifies as ‘any person in the supply chain 
other than the   
operator who, in the course of a commercial activity, makes relevant products  
﻿available on   
the market’) under the Regulation, depending on specific situations.   

3.10.    Who is an SME under the EUDR? (UPDATED)   

According to Art. 2(30) EUDR, ‘small and medium-sized enterprises’ or ‘SMEs’ means  
micro,   
small  and  medium-sized  undertakings  as  defined  in  Art.  3  of  Directive   
2013/34/EU.  The   
thresholds mentioned in Art. 3(5) and (6)  of Directive 2013/34/EU for  small,  
medium-sized   
and large groups have no relevance for the SME definition under the EUDR.   

Accounting  Directive  2013/34/EU,  as  amended  by  Commission  Delegated   
Directive  (EU)   
2023/2775,  states  that  medium-sized  undertakings  “shall  be  undertakings   
which  are  not   
micro-undertakings  or  small  undertakings  and  which  on  their  balance  sheet   
dates  do  not   
exceed the limits of at least two of the three following criteria: (a) balance sheet 
total: EUR   
25  000 000; (b) net turnover: EUR 50 000 000; (c) average number of employees  
during the   
financial year: 250.”   

The sizes for SMEs in the Directive 2013/34/EU apply in EU Member States only after  
having   
been transposed into national law.  Therefore,  for the purposes of the Regulation,  
the size   
criteria,  as  amended  by  Commission  Delegated  Directive  (EU)  2023/2775,  will 
 apply  to   
companies established  in the European Union only after such transposition  in the  
Member   
State in which a company is established.   

However, it should be noted that for Art. 38(3) of the Regulation and the entry into 
application   
of the  Regulation  by 30 June 2026, it is decisive whether an operator was  
established  as a   
micro-undertaking  or  small  undertaking  by  31  December  2020.  This  is   
dependent  on  the   
national  law  of  the  EU  Member  States  implementing  Directive  2013/34/EU  and 
 the  size   
thresholds contained therein which was in force by 31 December 2020.   

3.10.1  I am an SME company exempted from submitting DDS. Can the non-SME companies  

which I supply to require me to submit a DDS nevertheless? (NEW)   

There is no legal obligation for an SME trader or an SME downstream operator to  
﻿submit DDS   
or to ascertain that due diligence was exercised upstream; SME downstream operators  
can   
use the exemption of Art. 4(8) EUDR, whereas SME traders are not subject to the  
obligations   
of operators (see Art. 5 EUDR).   

                                                        39   
   
    

Hence, non-SME  downstream  companies  cannot rely on the  provisions of EUDR  to  
require   
SMEs mentioned above to submit a DDS.   

It should be noted that, if a company chooses to submit a DDS, it confirms that due  
diligence   
was carried out and no or only a negligible risk was found according to  Art. 4(2)  
EUDR (see   
also point 5 in Annex II).   

3.11.    Who is liable in case of a breach of the Regulation? (UPDATED)   

All operators retain responsibility for the compliance of the relevant product they  
place on   
the  EU market or export. The Regulation also requires operators (or traders which  
are not   
SMEs (pursuant to Art. 5(1) EUDR) to communicate all necessary information along the 
supply   
chain  (Art.  4(7)  EUDR).  For  SME  downstream  operators,  this  means  they  are 
 required  to   
obtain a due diligence statement reference numbers associated to products and make  
them   
available to competent authorities upon request. In cases of non-compliance,  
operators have   
to refrain from placing the product on the market or export it, and have to  
immediately inform   
competent authorities if they find a risk of non-compliance (Art. 4(4)(a), (5), (8)  
EUDR).   

Non-SME traders also retain responsibility for relevant products they make available 
on the   
EU market.   

3.12.    Who  is  the  operator  in  the  case  of  standing  trees  or  harvesting  
rights?   
  (UPDATED)   

Standing  trees  as  such  do  not  fall  within  the  scope  of  the  Regulation.   
Depending  on  the   
﻿detailed contractual agreements, the ‘operator’ at the moment of harvesting could be 
either   
the forest owner or the company that has the right to harvest relevant products,  
depending   
on who is placing the relevant product on the  EU market or exporting it from the  
EU.  In case   
a person concludes a contract by which it authorises the other party to the contract 
to harvest   
wood, the contracted party carrying out the harvest  is considered the operator if  
it directly   
and automatically becomes  the owner of  harvested logs  by the mere act of  
harvesting the   
trees. This is not the case where the applicable national law or the contract   
provide that the   
natural or legal person transfers, after harvesting, the right of ownership to the  
other party   
of the contract (for reference see, by analogy, Judgment C-370/23 of 21 November  
2024).   

3.13.    How does the Regulation apply to company groups? (UPDATED)   

The  due  diligence  obligations  apply  to  ‘persons’  in  accordance  with  Art.   
2(20)  EUDR,   
regardless of whether they are members of a company group or not.   

Subsidiaries  of  a  group,  like  any  legal  entity,  have  to  refer  to   
Directive  2013/34/EU  to   
determine  whether  their  entity  is  an  SME  or  not  (see  FAQ  3.10.).  The   
balance  sheet,  net   
turnover and number of employees of the individual legal entity, not of the company  
group   
as a whole, is decisive.    

For this reason, each entity must create a separate and individual account for its  
economic   
operator in the Information System. The system does not allow for a single account  
with the   
role of operator or trader to represent multiple companies or to create an economic  
operator   
account for a company group with multiple user companies.   

                                                        40   
   
    

However, pursuant  to  Art.  6  EUDR, it  is possible  for  operators and traders   
to  mandate  an   
authorised representative to submit and manage due diligence statements.  
Consequentially,   
company  groups  have  the  possibility  to  mandate  one  of  their  members  as   
﻿an  authorised   
representative to submit due diligence statements on behalf of all members of the  
group.  An   
authorised representative can use a single account to submit and manage DDS on  
behalf of   
all entities it represents. The authorised representative must be  established in  
the Union in   
accordance with Art. 2(22) EUDR. It should be noted that legal responsibility for  
compliance   
with the Regulation remains with the individual operators and traders.

3.14.     Who is the operator or trader when one company contracts another company  
to   
  provide relevant products that are linked to their commercial activities? For  
example, an   
  onsite cafeteria, small shop or a stand established besides a main business. (NEW) 
  

Depending on the detailed contractual agreements, the company responsible for  
supplying   
relevant products for use in the cafeteria, small shop, stand etc. (making available 
a relevant   
product on the EU market) is responsible for compliance of those products. The  
obligations   
of the company would depend on whether they were a non-SME trader (FAQ 3.8) or an  
SME   
trader (FAQ 3.5).    

For example:   

     1)   Contractor  C  is  an  SME  company  which,  under  its  contractual   
agreement  with   
          Supermarket B, is responsible for purchasing (from an EU manufacturer) and 
supplying   
          chocolate (HS 1806) to customers at Supermarket B shops. In this  
situation, Contractor   
          C is an SME trader which is only subject to the obligations under Art. 5  
(2) to (6) EUDR,   
          is exempt from due diligence requirements and does not retain  
responsibility for the   
          EUDR compliance of the chocolate.   
     2)   Contractor  A  runs  onsite  restaurants  on  behalf  of  non-SME  EU   
Supermarket  B.   
          Contractor A is a non-SME and, under its contractual agreement with  
Supermarket B,   
﻿          is   responsible  for  purchasing   and   supplying   chocolate   (HS    
1806)   at   an   onsite   
          restaurant on the establishment of Supermarket B. Contractor A buys the  
chocolate   
          from  an  EU  manufacturer,  so  in  this  situation,  Contractor  A  is   
a  non-SME  trader   
          responsible  for  the  compliance  of  the  chocolate  that  it  is   
making  available  at  the   
          cafeterias. Contractor A must ascertain that due diligence was carried out 
 upstream   
          and must submit a DDS for the chocolate that it sells; based on Art. 4(9)  
EUDR, it may   
          refer  to  upstream  DDS  numbers.  Supermarket  B  is  not  responsible   
for  the  EUDR   
          compliance of the chocolate.    
     3)   Contractor D is a non-SME company that runs confectionary stands at  
Supermarket B   
          shops.  The  confectionary  includes  chocolate  (HS  1806).  Under  their 
 contractual   
          agreements, Supermarket B buys the chocolate bars from a producer in a  
third country   
          and Contractor D only sells chocolate bars on behalf of Supermarket B  
without ever   
          owning them. In this situation, Supermarket B is therefore an operator  
responsible for

          performing  DD  for  the  chocolate  bars  and  submitting  a  DDS  for   
each  batch  of   
          chocolate  bars.  Contractor  D  is  not  responsible  for  the  EUDR   
compliance  of  the   
          chocolate bars.   

Fulfilling EUDR obligations is only required when the supplied products are in the  
scope of the   
Regulation (FAQ 5.13). Products that are not in scope, even if they contain  
components or   
elements  derived  from  in-scope  commodities  are  not  subject  to  the   
requirements  of  the   
Regulation  (FAQ  2.1).  Examples  for  such  products  out  of  scope  that  may   
﻿be  supplied  by   
contractors are sausages and similar meat preparations of cattle (HS 1601), or  
preparations   
with a basis of coffee, meaning coffee beverages (HS 2101).   

3.15.     How are the roles of ‘authorised representative’ under Art. 6 EUDR and  
‘customs   
  representative’ under Art. 18 of Regulation (EU) 952/2013 (UCC) articulated? (NEW) 
  

The two roles are separate:    

     -    An ‘authorised  representative’  under  Art. 6  EUDR is tasked to  submit  
a DDS in the   
          information  system  on  behalf  of  an  operator.  This  role  relates   
thus  only  to  the   
          obligation under Art. 4 EUDR.    
     -    A  ‘customs  representative’  under  Art.  18  UCC  is  tasked  to  lodge  
the  customs   
          declaration on behalf of another person. This role relates thus only to  
the customs   
          obligations under the UCC.    
It may happen that a company is offering both the services as an ‘authorised   
representative’   
and a ‘customs representative’, but both  roles  require two explicit and different  
mandates   
and imply two separate sets of responsibilities under each respective provision.    

Whatever       the    circumstances        (whether      or   not    designated      
 also    as   an   ‘authorised   
representative’ under Art. 6 EUDR), customs representatives are never an ‘operator’  
under   
the EUDR as they neither place on the market nor export relevant products.    

   

                                                         °°°°   

4.        Definitions   

These definitions are the basis for the  obligations for companies and stakeholders  
in third   
countries that have commercial relations with the EU, as well as for EU competent  
authorities.   

4.1.      What does ‘global deforestation’ mean?    

‘Global  deforestation’  means  deforestation  taking  place  worldwide  (both  in   
the  EU  and   
outside) in line with the definition set out in Art.  2 of the Regulation  (i.e. the 
﻿conversion of   
forest to agricultural use, whether human-induced or not).   

Deforestation  and  forest  degradation  are  among  the  main  drivers  of  climate 
 change  and   
biodiversity loss - the two key global environmental crises of our time.    

                                                          42   
   
    

The  main  cause  of  deforestation  and  forest  degradation  worldwide  is  the   
expansion  of   
agricultural land for the production of commodities such as soy, beef, palm oil,  
wood, cocoa,   
rubber  or  coffee.  As  a  major  economy  and  consumer  of  these  commodities,   
the  EU  is   
contributing to deforestation and forest degradation worldwide. The EU, therefore,  
has the   
responsibility to contribute to ending it.   

By  promoting  the  production  and  consumption  of  ‘deforestation-free'   
commodities  and   
products and reducing the EU's impact on global deforestation and forest  
degradation, the   
Regulation is expected to bring down EU-driven greenhouse gas emissions and  
biodiversity   
loss.   

4.2.     What does ‘plot of land’ mean? (UPDATED)   

The "plot of land" – the subject of geolocation under the Regulation – is defined in 
Art. 2(27)   
as  "land  within  a  single  real  estate  property,  as  recognised  by  the  law  
of  the  country  of   
production, which possesses sufficiently homogeneous conditions to allow an  
evaluation of   
the aggregate level of risk of deforestation and forest degradation associated with  
relevant   
commodities produced on that land."  For purposes of this  Regulation,  the key  
factor is to   
identify the plot of land used to produce commodities intended to place on the EU  
market –   
it is not necessary to list all plots owned by a single owner if some of these plots 
are not used   
to produce commodities covered by the Regulation or are not intended to be placed on 
the   
EU  market.    

If a single owner owns multiple plots of land, and places relevant products on the  
﻿market from   
all these plots, it is possible to declare all concerned plots in one DDS (see also  
FAQ 1.14.).   

4.3.     Which criteria does wood need to comply with?   

The wording of the deforestation-free definition in Art. 2(13)(b)  of the   
Regulation  (“….in   
case of relevant products that contain or have been made using wood…”) singles out  
wood   
from the product scope, creating the impression of a ‘special case’ and raising a  
question   
regarding the applicability of the “deforestation-free” criterion in Art. 3(a) of  
the Regulation   
to wood. Does wood need to comply with both criteria, related to deforestation and  
forest   
degradation, or only forest degradation?   

In  order  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Regulation,  wood  needs  to   
comply  with  both   
criteria: a) it needs to have been harvested from land not subject to deforestation  
after 31   
December 2020; and b) it needs to be harvested without inducing forest degradation  
after 31   
December 2020.   

4.4.     What are the compliant harvesting levels?   

If a wood operator in 2022 harvests 20% of a forest with a 100% cover and lets the  
land   
naturally regenerate, would the harvested wood comply with the Regulation? In 30  
years,   
once the forest will have been regenerated, could the same operation take place with 
the   
same conclusion on compliance with the Regulation?   

Under the regulation, “forest degradation” means structural changes to forest cover, 
taking   
the form of the conversion of primary forests or naturally regenerating forests into 
plantation   

                                                         43   
   
    

forests or into other wooded land, and the conversion of primary forests into  
planted forests   
 (Art. 2(7)).   

This   definition   covers   all   categories   of   forests   defined   by   the    
﻿Food   and   Agriculture   
 Organisation  of  the  United  Nations.  Therefore,  forest  degradation  under   
the  Regulation   
 consists of transforming certain types of forests into other kinds of forests or  
other wooded   
 land.   

 Different  levels  of  wood  harvesting  are  allowed,  provided  that  this  does  
not  result  in  a   
transformation falling under the definition of degradation.   

4.5.       How should the phrase ‘without inducing forest degradation’ within the  
definition   
   of ‘deforestation-free’ for relevant products that contain or have been made  
using wood   
   be understood?    

The element of the ‘deforestation-free’ definition referring specifically to forest  
degradation   
requires that wood needs to have “been harvested from the forest without inducing  
forest   
degradation after 31 December 2020” (Art. 2(13)(b) EUDR). The reference to  
‘inducing’ creates   
a causal link between the wood harvesting and the process of forest degradation.    
   
This  reflects  the  fact  that  forests  may  be  impacted  by  other  processes,   
including  climate   
change, disease outbreaks, fires, etc. These potential forms of forest degradation  
are beyond   
the scope of the Regulation; the EUDR  addresses forest  degradation driven by the  
forestry   
activities associated with wood harvesting and subsequent regeneration of the  
forest.    
   
The relevant products would not be compliant with the Regulation if they were  
sourced from   
 an  area  where  harvesting  activities  induced  forest  degradation.  Operators   
could  take  into   
 account all data and information available at the date of harvest,  mainly forest  
management   
 legislation of the country, forest management plans, but also reforestation plans  
and planned   
 post-harvesting        activities,    restoration      and     conservation         
plans,    other     types    of   plans,   
 management  procedures,  etc.  -  to  assess whether  there  is  a  risk  that the  
harvest  induces   
forest degradation.    
   
If the degraded status of the forest persists over time, any future harvesting on a  
plot of land   
﻿where wood harvesting operations have provoked forest degradation after 31 December  
2020   
would  not  be  ‘deforestation-free’  and  the  relevant  products  could  not  be   
placed  on  the   
market. On the contrary, if in the future the forest is regenerated and its status  
changes into   
a forest category that would not have been considered as falling under the  
definition of forest   
degradation in the first place, then the wood extracted from new harvesting  
activities on that   
plot of land could be considered ‘deforestation-free’.    
   
4.6.       How should the question of whether a wood product is free of forest  
degradation   
   be assessed and what is the relevant time period under consideration? (UPDATED)   

Under the Regulation, “forest degradation” means structural changes to forest cover, 
taking   
the form of the conversion of primary forests or naturally regenerating forests into 
plantation   
forests or into other wooded land, and the conversion of primary forests into  
planted forests   
(Art. 2(7)).    

                                                             44   
   
    

    
                                            ‘Forest degradation’ means:    
                                        Structural changes to forest cover,    
                                          taking the form of conversion of    
                        1) Primary forests                                   2)  
Naturally regenerating forests    
                                 into                                                
            into    
    a) Planted          b) Plantation          c) Other wooded               a)  
Plantation            b) Other wooded   
      forests               forests                    land                       
forests                       land    
                                                                                     
                    
 To  comply  with  the  forest  degradation  element  of  the  ‘deforestation-free’  
definition,   
operators will need to establish whether the forest type prior to and including 31  
December   
2020 was primary forest or naturally regenerating forest (the two forest types to  
which the   
‘forest degradation’ definition applies), then assess whether the forestry  
activities associated   
﻿with wood harvesting, as well as planned post-harvesting activities, could cause or  
bring about   
(induce) a conversion, or have caused a conversion, to a different forest type  
amounting to   
‘forest degradation’.    
    
It is important to take into account the relevant forest management legislation of  
the country,   
including forest sustainable management plans or legal framework for sustainable  
harvesting,   
as well as information and data on the pre-harvest state of the forest, the  
harvesting regime   
and  its  likely  impacts,  the  regeneration  treatments,  other  planned  forest   
protection  and   
restoration measures, and other information relating to the risk assessment criteria 
detailed   
in  Art.   10  of  the  Regulation. This  could  include  official  documentation   
issued  by  forest   
authorities      outlining   reforestation   obligations   and   conditions,    
contractual   agreements   
between  the  parties,  or  other  relevant  information  obtained  from  the   
landowner  or  their   
representatives.   
    
If there is evidence indicating that harvesting activities may induce forest  
degradation*, then   
the wood product cannot be placed on, made available on, or exported from, the  EU   
market   
unless this risk is mitigated to no or negligible level.    
   
If, at the moment of harvest, the intended end-purpose of the plot of land  
(reforestation or   
conversion) is not known, then there is a risk that these harvesting activities may  
induce forest   
degradation. Hence those wood products cannot be placed on, made available on, or  
exported   
from, the EU market unless this risk is mitigated to no or negligible level.    
    
*Some examples of indications that harvesting activities may induce forest  
degradation could   
include:   
      •    management          plans   (or     other     available   information)    
      indicating   that       proposed   
           harvesting       and    regeneration        activities     may   be       
insufficient     to    prevent      forest   
           degradation in line with the definitions of the Regulation,   
      •    harvesting activities carried out deviate from those proposed in the  
forest sustainable   
           management plan or those authorised by the legal framework of the  
country,    
﻿      •    post-harvest planting and forest management plan appears to meet the  
criteria for   
           ‘planted’ or ‘plantation forest’, in line with the definitions of the  
Regulation, or    
      •    planned  regeneration  measures  (i.e.  planting  or  seeding)  or  the   
absence  of  such   
           planned measures.   

                                                              45   
   
    

              
4.7.       Can a wood product be free of forest degradation if it was harvested from 
a forest   
   that has undergone structural changes after 31 December 2020 that were not  
induced by   
   harvesting activities?    

Yes,  if  forest  degradation  after  2020  is  provoked  by  other  processes  like 
 climate  change,   
disease outbreaks, or fires that are unrelated to the harvesting operations or  
deforestation   
activities, the products of harvesting activities on those plots of land could still 
be considered   
deforestation-free, provided that the harvesting operations themselves do not induce 
forest   
degradation.    
   
 In those cases, it would be important to have sufficient data and evidence to  
demonstrate   
that  any  change  in  forest  status  between  the  two  time  periods  was   
unrelated  to  wood   
 harvesting.    
    
 In addition, when the purpose of the harvesting of trees is forest protection – for 
instance,   
when  harvesting damaged wood after a storm or a fire; or when cutting infected  
trees to   
 prevent the spread of pests and disease –, it should not be understood that  
harvesting has   
 “induced” the forest degradation. In those cases, it would be important to have  
sufficient data   
 and evidence to demonstrate the actual purpose of the tree harvesting.    
    
4.8.       In    some      cases,     evidence        for   wood       harvesting    
    operations        inducing       ‘forest   
   degradation’ may not be evident for some time after a wood product has been  
placed on   
   (or made available or exported from) the European Union market. Can operators be  
﻿liable   
   for events that happen after the submission of the due diligence statement?    

Would the relevant wood products be considered deforestation free?    
    
The relevant products would not be compliant with the Regulation if they were  
sourced from   
 an  area  where  harvesting  activities  induced  forest  degradation   in  the   
period  prior  to   
 submitting a due diligence statement.    
    
In  submitting  the  due  diligence  statement,  an  operator  assumes   
responsibility for  the  due   
diligence process and the compliance of the relevant products with Art.  3 a) and  
b). In this   
process the operator should take into account all relevant information and data,  
including for   
the risk factors set out in Art .  10.    
    
A breach of the due diligence obligations could be found, for example, if the risk  
assessment   
part of the due diligence has not been properly conducted, because relevant  
information or   
specified criteria were overlooked, including post-harvesting plans for the plot of  
land.    
    
Where the due diligence was found not to have been properly conducted, any  
downstream   
operators or traders would not be able to rely on an existing due diligence  
statement for the   
relevant products.    
    
In contrast, where due diligence was properly exercised at the time, and the  
relevant products   
were compliant when they were placed on the market, the compliant status of the  
relevant   
products – and those of derived products – will not change based on events that  
occur after a   

                                                                46   
   
    

product has been placed on the market (or exported) that could not have been  
identified as a   
potential  risk  at  the  time  of  submitting  a  due  diligence  statement.  Nor   
will  this  affect  the   
compliance status of the operator.    
    
4.9.       Does the definition of “forest degradation”  disincentivize  the  
﻿deliberate planting   
   and  seeding  of  trees,  which  may  be  an  important  practice  for  the   
protection  and   
   restoration of forests?    

In  certain  forest  types,  deliberate  planting  or  seeding  may  be  an   
effective  and  preferred   
method  of  forest  restoration,  including  after  natural  events  (e.g.  storms,  
fire)  or  following   
management measures for invasive alien species, pests or disease, or to promote  
regeneration   
on  hard  environments  including  poor  soils,  drought,  frost  and  or  where   
effects  of  climate   
change  are  noticeable.  Therefore,  and  while  the  conversion  of  primary   
forest  or  naturally   
regenerating  forest  to  plantation  forest  would  constitute  “forest   
degradation”,  under  the   
Regulation  the  definition  ‘plantation  forest’  excludes  “forests  planted  for  
protection  or   
ecosystem restoration, as well as forests established through planting or seeding,  
which at   
stand maturity resemble or will resemble naturally regenerating forests”.   
This exception should logically also apply to ‘planted forests’.   
   
4.10.     How to apply “trees able to reach those thresholds in situ”?    

 How should we apply the clause “trees able to reach those thresholds in situ”  
related to   
tree height and canopy cover in the definition of “forest” in Art. 2(4) of the  
Regulation?   

 If the woody vegetation has or is expected to surpass more than 10% canopy cover of 
tree   
 species  with  a  height  or  expected  height  of  5  metres  or  more,  it   
should  be  classified  as   
 “forest”,  based  on  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organisation  (FAO)  definition. 
 For  example,   
young stands that have not yet but are expected to reach a crown density of 10  
percent and   
 a tree height of 5 metres  are included under  the definition of “forest”, as are  
temporarily   
 unstocked areas, whereas the predominant use of the area remains forest.   

4.11.     Which forest land use change complies with the Regulation?    

 Deforestation is defined in Art. 2(3) of the Regulation as “conversion of forest to 
agricultural   
 use.” Is any other forest land-use change compliant with the Regulation?   

 Deforestation  under  the  Regulation  is  defined  as  conversion  of  forest  to  
﻿agricultural  use.   
 Conversion for other uses such as urban development or infrastructure does not fall 
under   
the  deforestation  definition.  For  instance,  wood  from  a  forest  area  that   
has  been  legally   
 harvested to build a road would be compliant with the Regulation.   

4.12.     Would a natural disaster count as deforestation?   

The definition of “deforestation” in the Regulation encompasses the conversion of  
forest to   
 agricultural  use,  whether  human-induced  or  not,  which  includes  situations   
due  to  natural   
 disasters.  A  forest  that  has  experienced  a  fire  and  is  then  subsequently 
 converted  into   
 agricultural land (after the cut-off date) would be considered  as “deforestation”  
under the   
 Regulation. In this specific case, an operator would be prohibited from sourcing  
commodities   
within  the  scope  of  the  Regulation  from  that  area  (but  not  because  of   
the  forest  fire).   

                                                            47   
   
    

Conversely, if the affected forest is allowed to regenerate, it would not be deemed  
to amount   
to “deforestation”, and an operator could source wood from that forest once it has  
regrown.   

4.13.     Will ‘other wooded land’ or other ecosystems be included? (UPDATED)   

The Regulation relies on the definition of ‘forest’ of the Food and Agriculture  
Organization   
(FAO) of the United Nations. This includes four billion hectares of forests –  the  
majority of   
habitable land area not already used by agriculture –  which encompasses areas  
defined as   
savannahs, wetlands and other valuable ecosystems in national laws.   

As part of the  review  procedure  outlined in  Art.  34  EUDR, the  Commission   
will assess the   
impact of expanding the scope of the Regulation to  ‘other wooded land’ and to  
ecosystems   
other than ‘forests’.   

The conversion from primary or naturally regenerating forest to plantation forests  
or to other   
wooded  land  is  already  part  of  the  definition  of  ‘forest  degradation’,   
﻿and  wood  products   
coming from such converted land cannot be placed on the EU market or exported.   

4.14.     Is rubber cultivation considered as ‘agricultural use’ under the  
Regulation?    

Yes,  rubber  cultivation  falls  within  the  definition  of  ‘agricultural   
plantation’  under  the   
Regulation,  which  means  ‘land with tree stands in agricultural production  
systems, such as   
fruit tree plantations, oil palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry  
systems where   
crops  are  grown  under  tree  cover’.  This  definition  includes  all   
plantations  of  relevant   
commodities other than wood. Agricultural plantations are excluded from the  
definition of   
‘forest’’.  This  means  that  the  replacement  of  a  forest  with  a  rubber   
plantation  would  be   
considered as deforestation under the Regulation.    

   

                                                          °°°°   

                                                                

5.        Due Diligence   

5.1.      What are my obligations as an operator? (UPDATED)   

As a general rule, operators (and traders which are not SMEs) will have to set up  
and maintain   
a Due Diligence System in accordance with Art 12 of EUDR.   

The exercise of due diligence consists of three steps.   

As step one, they would need to collect the information referred to in Art. 9 of the 
Regulation,   
such as the commodity or product which they intend to place (or make available in  
case of   
non-SME traders) on the  EU market or export, including under customs procedures  
‘release   
for  free  circulation’  and  ‘export’,  as  well  as  the  respective  quantity,   
supplier,  country  of   
production, evidence of legal harvest, among others. A key requirement, in this  
step, is to   
obtain the geographic coordinates of the plots of land where the relevant commodity  
was   

                                                           48   
﻿   
    

produced  and  to  provide  relevant  information  –  product,  CN  code,  quantity, 
 country  of   
production, geolocation coordinates – in the due diligence statement to be submitted 
via the   
Information System. If the operator cannot collect the required information, it must 
refrain   
from placing on the  EU market or exporting the relevant product concerned. Failing  
to do so   
would result in a violation of the Regulation, which could lead to sanctions.   

If  the  operator  cannot  collect  the  required  information,  it  must  refrain   
from  placing  the   
affected products on the European Union market or exporting from it. Failing to do  
so would   
result in a violation of the Regulation, which could lead to potential sanctions.   

In step two, companies will need to feed the information gathered under the first  
step into   
the risk assessment pillar of their Due Diligence Systems to verify and evaluate the 
risk of non-  
compliant products entering the supply chain, taking into account the criteria  
described in   
Art. 10 of the Regulation. Operators need to demonstrate how the information  
gathered was   
checked against the risk assessment criteria and how they determined the risk.   

In step three, they will need to take adequate and proportionate mitigation measures 
in case   
they find under step two more than a negligible risk of non-compliance in order to  
make sure   
that the risk becomes negligible, taking into account the criteria described in Art. 
 11  of the   
Regulation. These measures need to be documented.   

Operators sourcing commodities entirely from areas classified as low risk will be  
subject to   
simplified due diligence obligations. According to Art. 13 of the Regulation, they  
will still need   
to collect information in line with Art. 9 and assess the complexity of the supply  
chain and the   
risk of circumvention  and the risk of mixing the product with products of unknown  
origin  or   
origin of standard or high risk countries, but they will not be required to assess  
and mitigate   
risks (Art.  10  and 11  EUDR) unless the operator  obtains  or  is  made  aware  of 
 any relevant   
information, including substantiated concerns submitted under Art. 31 , that would  
﻿point to   
a risk that the relevant products do not comply with this Regulation (Art.  13(2)   
EUDR).  For   
more   information,   see   Chapter   4   b)   of   the   Commission   Notice    
Guidance   document   
(C/2024/6789).   

5.2.     Who can mandate an 'authorised representative’? (UPDATED)   

Pursuant  to  Art.   6   of  the   Regulation,  operators   and  traders  may   
mandate  authorised   
representatives  to  submit  a  due  diligence  statement  on  their  behalf.  In   
this  case,  the   
operators  and  non-SME traders  will retain responsibility for the compliance of  
the relevant   
products.   

If the operator is a natural person or microenterprise, it may mandate the next  
operator or   
trader in the supply chain to act as its authorised representative, provided it is  
not a natural   
person or micro-enterprise. In this case, the mandating operator retains  
responsibility for the   
compliance of the product.   

According to Art. 2(22) of the Regulation, the authorised representative must be  
established   
in the EU and must have received a written mandate from an operator or trader.   

                                                         49   
   
    

5.2.1. What is an authorised representative? Can one authorised representative  
represent   
multiple operators and traders? Which EUDR obligations can an authorised  
representative   
perform? (NEW)   

An authorised representative is a natural or legal person that acts on behalf of an  
operator or   
trader by submitting a Due diligence statement for them (Art. 6 EUDR). According to  
Art. 2(22)   
EUDR,  an  authorised  representative  must  be  established  in  the  Union  and   
must  receive  a   
written mandate from an operator or trader in order to act on their  behalf. In  
principle, any   
natural  or  legal  person  (private  or  public)  established  in  the  EU  can   
act  as  authorised   
representative, no matter whether they actively participate in a supply chain or  
﻿not.   

When submitting DDS, authorised representatives must register in the Information  
System   
and choose between the roles ‘Representing Operator’ or ‘Representing Trader’. These 
roles   
allow authorised representatives to be authenticated with their own credentials and  
submit   
Due  Diligence  Statements  on  behalf  of  their  clients.  It  is  possible  for   
an  authorised   
representative  to  be  mandated  by  multiple  operators and traders if the  
above-mentioned   
requirements are met. The details of the operator and trader shall be introduced in  
the fields   
when submitting a DDS allowing unique identification of the represented operator or  
trader:    

                                                                                     
        

Even  if  an  authorised  representative  submits  a  due  diligence  statement,   
the  obligation to   
exercise  /  ascertain  due  diligence  remains  with  the  operator  or  trader.   
Accordingly,  the   
operator or trader retains responsibility for compliance of relevant products with  
Art. 3 EUDR.   

In the case of an operator being a natural person or a microenterprise, they may  
mandate the   
next  operator  or  trader  further  down  the  supply  chain  that  is  not  a   
natural  person  or  a   
microenterprise to act as an authorised representative, see Art. 6(3) EUDR.   

                                                            50   
   
    

5.3.     Can companies conduct due diligence on behalf of subsidiaries?   

The  internal  organisation  and  due  diligence  policy  of  a  group  of   
companies  (a  mother   
company and its subsidiaries) is not governed by the Regulation. The operator or  
trader that   
places or makes available on the EU market or exports a relevant product, is  
responsible for   
the compliance of the product and for overall compliance with the Regulation. Hence, 
it is its   
name that should  be provided  in the due diligence statement,  and it  should   
retain the full   
responsibility under the Regulation.   
﻿5.4.     What about re-importing a product? What are my due diligence obligations if 
I am   
  re-importing a product that was previously exported from the EU? (NEW)   

Where an operator re-imports (i.e., releases for free circulation) a product that  
was previously   
exported from the EU market and places it under the customs procedure ‘release for  
free   
circulation’, it is considered a “downstream operator”.    

The re-importer, who is releasing a relevant product for free circulation and hence  
placing it   
on the market is subject to the obligations of downstream operators, which are  
dependent   
on the size of the re-importer:    

If the re-importer is an SME operator, Art. 4(8) EUDR applies (see FAQ 5.6.1),  
meaning the re-  
importer does not need to carry out due diligence. At customs, the SME re-importer  
provides   
the reference number(s) received from its supplier(s) in the customs declaration.    

If the re-importer is a non-SME, already existing due diligence statements can help  
ascertain   
that due diligence was exercised upstream in accordance with Art. 4(9) EUDR. The  
non-SME   
re-importer needs to submit a DDS prior to re-importing and needs to provide the  
reference   
number received for its DDS when releasing products for free circulation.    

The above applies equally where a product that is imported contains relevant  
products that   
were previously placed on the EU market and have been subject to due diligence  
(example:   
cocoa beans are exported from the EU to a third country to manufacture chocolate,  
and the   
chocolate is subsequently released for free circulation in the EU).    

For parts of relevant products that have not been subject to due diligence,  
operators must   
exercise due diligence and submit a DDS.   

In  case  of the  re-import  of  a  product  which  was  initially placed  on  the  
market during  the   
transitional period (itself or in the form of an upstream relevant product), as  
explained in FAQ   
9.2., a conventional DDS reference number will be communicated by the Commission  
that   
can be used in the customs declaration submitted for re-import. For further  
﻿information on   
the transitional period, see FAQs 9.1.-9.6.   

5.5.     Which customs procedures are affected?   

Relevant  products  placed  under  other  customs  procedures  than  the  ‘release   
for  free   
circulation’ or ‘export’ (e.g. customs warehousing, inward processing, temporary  
admission   
etc.) are not subject to the Regulation.    

                                                        51   
   
    

5.6.      Does  placing  on  the  market  of  products  not  produced  in the EU   
require customs   
  clearing?    

Would a customs declaration be sufficient documentation in this context?    

Yes, placing on the market relevant commodities or relevant products produced  
outside of   
the  EU  requires  customs  clearance  prior  to  placing  on  the  market.  In   
this  context,  only  a   
customs declaration (neither a bill of lading nor a  other commercial or logistics  
document)   
would  be  considered  as  adequate  evidence,  if  it  can  be  directly  linked   
to  the  product  in   
question.   

5.6.1.   How does the Regulation apply to exports? (NEW)   

The Regulation applies both to exports and to imports. Operators exporting relevant  
products   
from the EU market will have to include the reference number of the due diligence  
statement   
in their export declaration. Operators exporting products made with commodities or  
other   
products that were already covered by a due diligence statement may also avail  
themselves   
of relevant simplifications in Art. 4 EUDR (i.e., Art. 4(8)  and 4(9) EUDR) (see  
information for   
products  produced  in  the  EU).  In  particular,  a  downstream  SME  operator   
exporting  from   
Union market may avail itself of Art. 4(8) EUDR; in such a case, the SME operator  
must provide   
to  customs  in  the  export  declaration  the  due  diligence  statement  reference 
 number(s)   
obtained from the previous operator(s) or trader(s) in the supply chain.   
﻿5.7.     What is the role of certification or verification schemes? (UPDATED)   

Certification schemes can be used by supply chain members to help their risk  
assessment to   
the extent the certification covers the information needed to comply with their  
obligations   
under  the  regulation.  Operators  and  traders  which  are  not  SMEs  will  still 
 be  required  to   
exercise due diligence, and they will remain responsible for any breach.   

The    European       Commission’s         Guidance       document        
(C/2024/6789)         provides     further   
explanations   on   the   role   of   certification   and   third-party    
verification   schemes   in   risk   
assessment and risk mitigation.    

5.8.      How long should documentation be kept?    

How long should the operator keep the documentation used for the due diligence  
exercise?   
Do  SME  traders  have  to  keep  the  relevant  information  about  the relevant   
product  they   
place or make available on the EU market or export? What is considered as the  
beginning   
of this duration? (UPDATED)   

Operators should collect, organise, and keep for five years from the date of the  
placing on the   
EU  market  or  export  of  the  relevant  commodities  and  relevant  products  the 
 information   
gathered  based  on  Art.  9  of  the  Regulation,  accompanied  by  evidence.   
Based  on  the   
provisions  of  Art.   10(4)  and  Art.   11(3)  of  the  Regulation,  operators   
should  be  able  to   
demonstrate how due diligence was carried out and what mitigation measures were put  
in   
place  in  case  risk  was  identified.  Relevant  documentation  about  these   
measures  must  be   
saved for at least five years after the due diligence exercise was carried out.  
Operators must   
also  keep  record  of  the  due  diligence  statements  for  five  years  from  the 
 date  when  the   

                                                         52   
   
    

statement is submitted in the Information System, which is prior to the date of  
placing the   
﻿product on the  EU  market or exporting it. In that regard, non-SME traders have the 
same   
obligations as the operators.   

SME traders must keep the information listed in Art.  5(3)  of the Regulation  for  
at least five   
years, including the due diligence reference numbers, from the date of the making  
available   
on the EU market of relevant products.   

5.9.     What are the criteria for ‘negligible risk products’?   

‘Negligible risk’ refers to the level of risk that applies to relevant products to  
be placed on the   
EU  market or exported  from the  EU, where, on the  basis of  a full  assessment   
of product-  
specific and general information, and, where necessary, of the application of the  
appropriate   
mitigation measures, those commodities or products show no cause for concern as to  
not   
being in compliance with Art. 3  points (a) or (b) of the Regulation.   

5.10.    Are ‘negligible risk products’ exempt?   

Can we understand “negligible risk”  under Art. 2(26) of the Regulation  read  
together with   
Art.  10(1) as providing an exemption from the Regulation?   

No. Operators and traders [that are not SMEs] may only reach a conclusion on  
‘negligible risk’   
(which  is  a  pre-condition  for  placing  or  making  available  on  the  EU   
market  or  exporting   
relevant  products) as  a  result  of  conducting  due  diligence (pursuant  to   
Art.  4(1)  of  the   
Regulation). Conducting due diligence is a core obligation of operators and traders  
under this   
Regulation, which is not subject to any exemption.   

Please note that the ‘negligible risk’ element does not apply to commodities (there  
is no ‘risk   
status’ for each commodity in the Regulation).   

5.11.    Could certain commodities from a given country be considered ‘negligible  
risk’?   

Could  palm  oil,  rubber,  coffee,  cacao,  or  timber  from  a  given  country  be 
 considered   
‘negligible risk’?   

No. See question above.   
﻿5.12.    When checking compliance with the ‘deforestation-free’  requirement, what  
is the   
  point in time the checks should focus on?    

The assessment of whether the commodity has contributed to deforestation is  
conducted by   
looking backwards in time to see if the crop land used to be a forest (in line with  
definition in   
Art. 2) since the cut-off date of the Regulation (namely, 31 December 2020).   

                                                         53   
   
    

5.13.     What  products  would  require  documentation  by  operators  and  traders 
 in  the   
   context of their due diligence obligations?    

Documentation is only required for the products in scope of the regulation (HS Codes 
listed in   
Annex I). No documentation is required for articles produced with  commodities that  
are out   
of scope (namely, if they are not listed in Annex I).   

5.14.     When will non-SME operators have to produce their first annual reports  
pursuant to   
   Art.  12(3) of the Regulation? (UPDATED)   

The EUDR will be enforceable from 30 December 2025 (except for micro and small  
companies,   
where the date is 30 June 2026). Art. 12(3) requires relevant companies to publish  
an annual   
report about their activities to comply with requirements under the EUDR. As 2026  
will be the   
first year for which the EUDR applies, the first report (covering the year 2026)  
will have to be   
published after 30 December 2026.   
   
Companies which have already reported relevant elements covered in Art. 12(3) EUDR  
in the   
context  of  their  reporting  obligations  under  other  EU  relevant  legislation  
(such  as  the  EU   
Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive) do not have to repeat the   
reporting.   
   
5.15.     Will there be a template for the due diligence statement that actors in  
the seven   
   commodity sectors covered by the Regulation need to fill?    
﻿The template for operators and traders' due diligence statement is the same for all  
commodity   
sectors (see Annex II of the Regulation) on which the form in the Information System 
is based.   

5.16.     Will there be  a  set  of  pre-determined format  or  list  of  questions  
to  perform due   
   diligence?    

No.  Operators  and  traders  must  comply  with  their  respective  due  diligence  
obligations  in   
accordance with Arts. 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the Regulation. Achieving no or negligible  
risk is a pre-  
requisite for placing/making available/exporting relevant products on/from the EU  
market.   

Please note that due  diligence is not a “tick-the-box exercise”. Hence, it may  
depend on the   
specific  context  and  supply  chain,  provided  that  the  different  steps  of   
due  diligence  as   
described in the regulation (i.e. information requirement, risk assessment and risk  
mitigation,   
in line with Art. 9, 10 and 11 EUDR) are covered.   

5.17.     Do  operators  and  traders  (and/or  their  authorised  representatives)  
who  wish  to   
   place, make available or export relevant products on/from the EU market, have to  
register   
   in the Information System?   

Operators  and  traders  must  register  if  they  are  subject  to  submitting  a   
D ue  Diligence   
Statement under this Regulation. Alternatively, they can request the services of an  
Authorised   
Representative (who, in turn, must be registered in the system as such).   

                                                            54   
   
    

5.18.    Will the Commission issue further details concerning the satellite imagery  
tools to   
  be used to check compliance of relevant products (for instance, on minimum  
resolution)?    

While spatial imagery tools can greatly help operators and traders in conducting  
their due   
diligence obligations (to ascertain that a product is deforestation-free) and Member 
States’   
competent  authorities  in  performing  checks,  the  Regulation  does  not  impose  
﻿the  use  of   
specific satellite imagery tools, or threshold on satellite imagery resolution, to  
document the   
absence of deforestation.    

5.19.    How often should due diligence statements be submitted in the Information  
System,   
  and can they cover multiple shipments/batches? What about situations where  
relevant   
  products may be placed on the market successively over a period of time? (UPDATED) 
  

A  due   diligence  statement  can  cover  multiple  physical  batches/shipments    
of  multiple   
different relevant products. In these situations, the operator (or non-SME trader,  
see Art. 5(1)   
EUDR) has to confirm that due diligence was carried out for all relevant products  
intended to   
be  placed  on,  made  available  on  the  Union  market,  or  exported  and  that   
no  or  only  a   
negligible risk was found that the relevant products do not comply with Art. 3,  
point (a) or (b),   
of the Regulation (Annex II) and that the operator assumes responsibility for the  
compliance   
of the relevant products with Art. 3 EUDR (Art. 4(3) EUDR).   

In addition, there are legal requirements and practical considerations that must be  
taken into   
account:   

     1.   The quantity of all relevant products placed on, made available on the  
Union market,   
         or exported must be covered by a due diligence statement (Art. 3(c) EUDR)  
and that   
         statement must be submitted prior to any batches/shipments of relevant  
products   
         being placed on the market, made available or exported (Art. 4(2) EUDR).    
     2.   Once the quantity of products covered by the due diligence statement has  
been fully   
         placed  on  the  market  or  exported,  a  new  statement  must  be  filed  
for  additional   
         quantities by the same operator.   
     3.   In accordance with Art.  12(2) of the EUDR, operators shall review their  
due diligence   
         system   once   a   year.   Therefore,   a   due   diligence   statement    
should   not   cover   
         shipments/batches over a period longer than one year from the time of  
submission of   
         the   statement.   In   addition,   a   longe r   time   period   could    
lead   to   difficulties   in   
﻿         demonstrating the correspondence between declared products and products  
actually   
         (intended to be) placed on the market or exported.   
     4.   With a due diligence statement, the operator confirms that due diligence  
was carried   
         out for all relevant products jointly or individually that are  intended to 
be placed on,   
         made available on the Union market, or exported and that there is no or  
negligible   
         risks  of  non-compliance  of  the  relevant  products.  Therefore,  in   
principle  a  due   
         diligence statement should cover commodities that have already been  
produced, i.e.,   
         grown, harvested,  obtained from  or raised  on  relevant plots of land or, 
as regards   
         cattle, on establishments. In other words, in principle operators should be 
able to link   
         a  due  diligence  statement  to  existing  commodities.  On  the  other   
hand,  it  is  not   
         necessary that the individual product that will be placed on the market has 
already   
         been manufactured: for example, in the case of declaring wooden furniture   
in a DDS,   
         while the trees should have already been harvested at the time of DDS  
submission for   
         the furniture, it is not necessary that the furniture has already been  
manufactured.   

                                                        55   
   
    

     5.   The   quantities  of   the  products   declared   in  the   due    
diligence   statement   must   
          correspond to the quantities that have been subject to the due diligence  
exercise by   
         the operator and are intended to be placed or made available on the EU  
market or   
          exported. This includes that a product must not be covered by multiple Due 
Diligence   
          Statements submitted by the same person.  If a person does not know which  
products   
          will  be  sold  on  the  EU  market,  and  which  will  be  exported  at   
the  time  of  DDS   
          submission,  it  is  possible  to  declare  all  products  with  an   
“export”  DDS  and  keep   
          documentation  demonstrating  the  corresponding  quantities.  Upon   
demand  of  the   
          Competent   Authority,   operators   should   be   able   to   provide    
evidence   of   such   
﻿          correspondence in their due diligence system established in accordance  
with Art. 12   
          EUDR.  Unless  simplified  due  diligence  applies  (Art.  13  EUDR),  the 
 operator  has  to   
          provide evidence that  the risk  of non-compliance  (regarding  the   
deforestation-free   
          and the legality requirement) has been assessed in accordance with Art.  
10(2) EUDR   
          for all products, and that such risk is negligible for all declared  
products. Appropriate   
          records  demonstrating  the  above-mentioned  correspondence  must  be   
kept  for  5   
          years from the date of (last) placing or making available on the  market,  
to be made   
          available to the Competent Authority upon request (Art. 9 EUDR). Where the 
quantity   
          declared in the  DDS  has  not been  fully placed  or  made  available  on 
 the market or   
          exported,  the  operator  should  keep  appropriate  records  explaining   
the  difference   
          between the declared and the actual quantity placed or made available on  
the market   
          or exported must be kept for 5 years, to be made available to the  
Competent Authority   
          upon request (Art. 9 EUDR).   
     6.   An individual due diligence statement with its geolocation data must be  
within the   
          practical size limit established for upload into the Information System  
(25 MB).    
     7.   Where a due diligence statement covers multiple batches/shipments, this  
additional   
          complexity may increase the risk of non-compliance for the operator. The  
operator   
          assumes full responsibility for compliance of all batches/shipments and  
information   
          in the due diligence statement, country of production and geolocation of  
all plots of   
          land  included.  The  additional  complexity  may  be  of  relevance  to   
the  risk-based   
          approach used by Competent Authorities to identify the checks to be  
carried out (Art.   
          16 EUDR). Where relevant, interim measures or action for non-compliance  
may apply   
         to  all  relevant  products  covered  by  a  due  diligence  statement,   
including  those   
          contained in separate batches/shipments.   

   
5.20.     What is the latest date for submitting a DDS? (UPDATED)   
﻿According to Art. 4(1) EUDR, operators shall exercise due diligence in accordance  
with Art. 8   
EUDR prior to placing relevant products on the market or exporting them in order to  
prove   
that the relevant products comply with Art. 3 EUDR. The same applies to  non-SME  
traders   
according to Art. 5(1) EUDR.   
    
For  relevant  products  entering  the  Union  market  (import)  or  leaving  the   
Union  market   
(export) the reference number of the DDS shall be made available to customs  
authorities. For   
this purpose,  the  person  lodging the  customs declaration (known as “customs  
declarant”)   
shall include the DDS reference number on the customs declaration lodged for that  
relevant   
product, in accordance with Art. 26 EUDR. Therefore, the DDS shall be submitted, and 
the   

                                                          56   
   
    

reference  number  of  the  DDS  shall  be  obtained  prior  to  the  lodging  of   
the  customs   
               5  
declaration  .   
Where  a DDS  covers  multiple  shipments/batches  the same DDS  reference  number  
can be   
referred to in several customs declarations as long as the legal requirements of the 
EUDR,   
specifically as recalled in question 1, are respected.  It is equally possible to  
include multiple   
DDS reference numbers in one customs declaration.   
For commodities produced within the EU, the exact date of placing on the market  
should be   
understood when the product is physically available on the Union market (i.e., the  
commodity   
has been produced and in the case of a derived product, the product has been  
manufactured),   
and is supplied on the market (for distribution , consumption or use) and two or  
more legal   
or natural persons enter into an agreement in which the operator promises the supply 
of the   
relevant product. Such agreement could provide for the supply in return for payment  
or free   
of charge. To demonstrate in a forest related example, the DDS shall be  submitted  
by the   
latest  when  both  elements  are  fulfilled:  i)  the  harvested  logs  are   
available,  and  ii)  a   
﻿purchase/supply agreement of the harvested logs is finalized by agreeing on the  
supply to a   
third entity, for example a sawmill.    

This date is irrespective of the payment for the logs, the date of first shipment,  
or the date of   
transfer of ownership.   
   
5.21.     What is the earliest date for submitting a DDS? (NEW)   

According to Art. 4(1) EUDR, operators shall exercise due diligence in accordance  
with Art. 8   
EUDR prior to placing relevant products on the market or exporting them in order to  
prove   
that the relevant products comply with Art. 3 EUDR. The same applies to non-SME  
trader and   
downstream   non-SME   operators   when   ascertaining   that   due   diligence    
was   exercised   
according to Art. 4(9), 5(1) EUDR.   
   
The earliest a DDS can be submitted is after due diligence has been exercised or  
ascertained   
and when all information that is needed for submission is available (including the  
quantity   
planned to be placed or made available on the market or exported). It should also be 
noted   
that as set out in FAQ 5.19.,  a due diligence statement should not cover  
shipments/batches   
over a period longer than one year from the time of submission of the statement.   
   
5.22.     My company imports relevant products into the EU which are then sold on  
the EU   
   market to multiple clients without further manufacturing, or which are exported  
without   
  further manufacturing. Do I need to submit a DDS two times (prior to import and  
prior to   
  selling / export)? (NEW)   

As  the  import  due  diligence  statement  covers  the  products which  are   
supplied on  the  EU   
market, in the case in which the importer sells the products on the EU market or  
exports it   

                                           
5 In the mid- to long-term, it will be possible for operators and non-SME traders to 
submit at once their customs   

declarations and the DDS pursuant to Art. 28(2) of the EUDR. This situation is not  
yet applicable and thus not   
reflected yet in this document. Separate guidance and FAQs will be made available in 
﻿due time in this respect.

without further manufacturing, there is no need to submit another due diligence  
statement   
prior to the sale / export.    

It  should  be  noted  that  for  every  import  and  export,  a  DDS  reference   
number  must  be   
provided in accordance with Art. 26(4) EUDR. In the above-mentioned case, the  
reference   
number  created  for  import  can  be  entered  for  the  export  of  products   
which  have  not   
undergone manufacturing.

6.        Benchmarking and partnerships   

6.1.      What is country benchmarking? (UPDATED)   

The  benchmarking  system  operated  by  the  Commission  will  classify  countries, 
 or  parts   
thereof,  in  three  categories  (high,  standard  and  low  risk)  according  to   
the  level  of  risk  of   
producing commodities that are not deforestation-free in such countries.   

The criteria for the identification of the risk status of countries or parts thereof 
are defined in   
Art. 29 of the Regulation. Art. 29(2) EUDR mandates the Commission to develop a  
system and   
publish the list of countries, or parts thereof, that present a low or  high risk.  
It will be based   
on an objective and transparent assessment analysis of quantitative and qualitative  
criteria,   
taking  into  account  the  latest  scientific  evidence,  internationally   
recognised  sources,  and   
information verified on the ground.   

6.2.      What is the methodology? (UPDATED)   

The  main  principles  of  the  benchmarking  methodology  are  outlined  in  the   
﻿Annex  to  the   
Strategic  Framework  on  International  Cooperation,  published  by  the   
Commission  on  2   
                   6  
October 2024  .   

The Commission's  methodology is firmly rooted in a commitment to fairness,  
objectivity and   
transparency. It relies on quantitative criteria based on scientific evidence and  
internationally   
recognized latest available data, primarily from the Global Forest Resources  
Assessment by   
the   Food   and   Agriculture   Organization   of   the   United   Nations.   By    
focusing   on   these   
measurable factors, the Commission ensures that the classification process is  
grounded in   
solid data, while combined with a methodology for a qualitative assessment, where  
relevant.

                                                              58   
   
    

6.3.     The   development   of   the   benchmarking   system   under   the   EU    
Deforestation   
  Regulation       (EUDR)     is  regularly     presented      in   meetings      of 
  the    Multi-Stakeholder   
  Deforestation Platform and other relevant meetings. How can stakeholders  
contribute?   

How can producer countries and other stakeholders feed into the benchmarking  
process,   
and  how  will  information  supplied  by  producer  countries  and  other   
stakeholders  be   
evaluated, verified, and utilised?   

The Commission is required under Art. 29(5) of the Regulation to engage in a  
specific dialogue   
with all countries that are, or risk to be classified as, high risk, with the  
objective to reduce   
their  level  of  risk.  This  dialogue  will  be  an  opportunity  for  partner   
countries  to  provide   
additional relevant information and work in close contact with the EU ahead of the  
finalisation   
of the classification.   

6.4.     Can countries share relevant data with the Commission? (UPDATED)   
﻿Can  countries  share  data  that  they  consider  relevant  to  the  implementation 
 of  this   
Regulation   (such   as   data   on   deforestation   and   forest   degradation    
rates)   with   the   
Commission? If so, can they do so outside of the specific dialogue framework  
foreseen in   
Art. 29(5) of the Regulation?   

While this Regulation does not place any obligation on third countries to share  
relevant data   
with the EU, countries that wish to share such data with the EU are welcome to do so 
at any   
stage from the entry into force of the Regulation. They can do so regardless of  
whether the   
country is engaged in a specific dialogue with the EU, for instance under  Art.   
29(5) of this   
Regulation on benchmarking or in a different context.    

In addition, the Commission engages  with several countries, in particular those  
that have a   
significant trade in EUDR commodities with the EU. These dialogues also are an  
opportunity   
to share relevant data and information.    

6.5.     Will legality risks be considered?   

Will the benchmarking take into account legality risks  as well as deforestation and 
forest   
degradation? How will the legislation and forest policies of producer countries,  
particularly   
regarding 'legal deforestation', be assessed/taken into account during the  
benchmarking   
process?   

The list of criteria for benchmarking is set out in Art. 29 of the Regulation. The  
assessment of   
the Commission will be based on an objective and transparent assessment analysis,  
based on   
the criteria defined in Art. 29(3) and 29(4) of the Regulation. The relevant  
quantitative criteria   
are:  (a)  the  rate  of  deforestation  and  forest  degradation,  (b)  the  rate   
of  expansion  of   
agriculture land for relevant commodities, and (c) production trends of relevant  
commodities   
and of relevant products.   

As  envisaged  in  the  Regulation,  the  assessment  may  also  take  into  account 
 other  criteria   
including  (a)  information  supplied  by  governments  and  third  parties  (NGOs,  
﻿industry);  (b)   
agreements and other instruments between the country concerned and the Union and/or  
its   
Member  States  that  address  deforestation  and  forest  degradation;  (c)  the   
existence  of   

                                                         59   
   
    

national laws to fight deforestation and forest degradation and their enforcement;  
(d) the   
availability of  transparent  data  in  the  country;  (e)  if  applicable,  the   
existence,  compliance   
with, or effective enforcement of laws protecting the rights of indigenous peoples;  
(and (g)   
international sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council or the Council of the  
European   
Union on imports or exports of the relevant commodities and relevant products; etc.  

6.6.     What support is provided for producer countries and smallholders? (UPDATED) 
  

How  are  producer  countries  and  smallholders  being  supported  to  produce   
products  in   
compliance with the Regulation? How can we ensure that smallholders are not excluded 
  
from supply chains?   

The EU and its Member States are stepping up engagement with partner countries,  
consumer   
and  producer  countries  alike,  to  jointly  address  deforestation  and  forest   
degradation   
including through a global Team Europe Initiative  (TEI)  on Deforestation-free  
Value Chains.   
Partnerships and cooperation mechanisms under the TEI will support countries to  
address   
deforestation and forest degradation where a specific need has been detected, and  
where   
there is a demand to cooperate - for instance, to help smallholders and companies in 
ensuring   
working with  only  deforestation-free  supply  chains.  The  Commission  has   
already  financed   
projects  to  disseminate  information,  raise  awareness,  and  address  technical  
questions   
through workshops for smallholders in the most affected third countries.   

See more on opportunities for smallholders in the EUDR.   
﻿6.7.     What are the different elements of the Team Europe  Initiative? (UPDATED)   

What  is  the  interplay  between  the  different  elements  of  the  TEI   
initiative:  the  hub, the   
Sustainable  Agriculture  for  Forest  Ecosystems  (SAFE)  project,  FPI  projects   
and  facilities   
planned  in  this  context,  but  also  those  relevant  in  the  broader  context,  
for  example  at   
regional level? How will duplications be avoided?   

The Team Europe Initiative on Deforestation-free Value Chains is a joint effort by  
the EU and   
its   Member   States   designed   to   support   global   ambitions   on    
decoupling   agricultural   
production from deforestation in partnership with various stakeholders in Africa,  
Asia and   
Latin America  (current budget EUR  86 Mio). Through its activities and flagship  
projects, the   
EU  and  EU  Member  States  promote  the  inclusive  and  just  transition  of   
sustainable  value   
chains,  especially  for  smallholders  and  low-income  countries.  They  do  this  
by  supporting   
partner governments with creating enabling framework conditions for corporate action 
to   
minimize deforestation, reducing risks in complex value chains and crowding-in  
private sector   
investments  in  sustainable  agribusinesses.  The  initiative  also  supports   
smallholders  with   
forest  preservation  and  assists  Indigenous  Peoples  and  local  communities   
with  protecting   
their rights.   

This Team Europe Initiative (TEI) Hub (short: “Zero Deforestation Hub”)  provides  
information   
and   outreach   to   partner   countries   on   deforestation-free   value   chains 
  and   conducts   
knowledge-management to coordinate relevant pre-existing projects from EU and Member 
  
States, with upcoming activities dedicated to the goals of the TEI. This ensures  
that different   

                                                         60   
   
    

Team  Europe  activities  on  deforestation-free  value  chains  in  producing   
countries  can  be   
better aligned, gaps identified, and redundancies avoided.   

                                                                             7  
﻿The Sustainable  Agriculture  for  Forest  Ecosystems  (SAFE)   project  is  the   
most  important   
pillar on the cooperation side of the TEI (current budget EUR 65 Mio). SAFE is  
currently being   
implemented in Brazil, Ecuador, Indonesia Zambia, DRC, Vietnam, Peru, Uganda,  
Cameroon   
and  Burundi.  The  SAFE  project  will  be  further  scaled  up  to  cover  more   
countries  through   
upcoming  financial  contributions  from  Member  States.  The  project  focuses  on 
 support  to   
smallholders  in  their  transition  to  sustainable  and  deforestation-free  value 
 chains  and   
assisting producing countries in creating an enabling environment to retain and  
expand access   
to the EU market. The  SAFE  programme’s  current duration  is from 2024-2028  and  
can be   
scaled-up through contributions from Member States to the deforestation TEI.   

The Technical  Facility  on  Deforestation-free  Value  Chains is  a  flexible  and  
on-demand   
instrument to assist producing countries with expertise on technical requirements,  
such as   
geolocation, land-use mapping and traceability, with a particular focus on  
smallholders. These   
activities are  closely coordinated with EU Delegations and aligned with  
pre-existing projects   
as well as SAFE, in order to create synergies and avoid duplications.   

6.8.      How does the Team Europe initiative relate to the CSDDD? (UPDATED)   

 The TEI Hub will be working closely together with the upcoming EU Helpdesk on  
CSDDD, in   
particular with regards to agricultural value chains and smallholders which will be  
affected by   
both the EUDR and the CSDDD.   

6.9.      How can we mitigate the risk of operators avoiding certain supply chains  
or certain   
  producer countries/regions that are benchmarked as 'high risk'?   

Operators sourcing from standard and high-risk countries or parts of countries are  
subject to   
the same standard due diligence obligations. The only difference is that shipments  
from high-  
risk  countries  will  be  subject  to  enhanced  scrutiny  from  competent   
authorities  (9%  of   
operators sourcing from high-risk areas). In that sense, drastic changes of supply  
chains are   
not warranted or expected. Furthermore, high risk classification will entail a  
specific dialogue   
﻿with   the   Commission  to   address   jointly   the   root   causes  of    
deforestation   and  forest   
degradation, and with the objective to reduce their level of risk.   

6.10.     How will the EU ensure transparency?   

The process leading to the benchmarking system will be transparent. Regular updates  
and   
consultations  on  the  benchmarking  methodology  will  take  place  in  the   
Multi-stakeholder   
Platform on deforestation, where many third countries take part, alongside with the  
27 EU   
Member  States.  The  Commission  will  provide  updates  on  the approach  followed 
 and   
the  methodology used.    

Furthermore, in accordance with its  obligations under the Regulation, the  
Commission will   
engage in a specific dialogue with all countries that are, or risk to be classified  
as high risk   
(prior to making the classification), with the objective to reduce their level of  
risk.’ This will   

                                         
7 factsheet-tei-deforestation-free-value-chains-05122023_en.pdf.

ensure there will be no sudden announcement of risk status and will allow for more  
in-depth   
discussions.  This  dialogue  will  provide  an  opportunity  for  producer   
countries  to  provide   
additional relevant information.   

   

                                                         °°°°   

                                                              

7.        Digital implementation (the EUDR Information System)   

7.1.      What is the Information System and the 'EU Single Window'? (UPDATED)   

The Information System (IS) is the IT system which contains the  DDS submitted by  
operators   
and traders to comply with the requirements of the Regulation. The Information  
System  is   
﻿operational  and  provides  users  with  the  functionalities  listed  in  Art.   
33(2)  of  EUDR.  Its   
functionalities are further set out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU)  
2024/3084.   

The  EU Single Window Environment for Customs (EU SWE-C)  established by Regulation  
(EU)   
2022/2399  is a framework that enables interoperability between customs systems and  
non-  
customs  systems,  such  as  the  Information  System  established  pursuant  to   
Art.  33  of  the   
Regulation. The central component of EU SWE-C, known as the EU Customs Single Window 
  
Certificates  Exchange  System  (EU  CSW-CERTEX),  will  interconnect  the   
Information  System   
with national customs systems and will enable sharing and processing of data  
submitted to   
customs  and  non-customs  authorities  by  economic  operators.  The   EU  Customs  
Single   
Window will thus ensure information sharing in real-time and digital cooperation  
between   
customs   authorities   and   competent   authorities   in   charge   of   enforcing 
  non-customs   
formalities, including in the field of environmental protection.   

7.2.      What data security safeguards will they have? (UPDATED)   

The Information System and, subsequently, its interconnection with the EU Single  
Window   
Environment for Customs, will be aligned with the relevant and applicable provisions 
in terms   
of data protection  and cybersecurity safeguards. In line with the Union’s Open Data 
Policy,   
the  Commission  has  to  provide  access  to  the  wider  public  to  the  complete 
 anonymised   
datasets of the Information System in an open format that can be machine-readable  
and that   
ensures interoperability, re-use, and accessibility. These datasets will be properly 
aggregated   
and anonymised.    

7.3.      How can operators and traders register? (UPDATED)   

What can operators and traders use as an ID number/company registration number for  
the   
IS? How should domestic operators/traders, who do not have EORI numbers and may not  

have VAT numbers, register for the IS?   

Operators that import or export relevant commodities and relevant products need to  
﻿provide   
their  valid Economic Operators Registration and  Identification (EORI) number  
issued by an   
EU Member State or the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland (XI) when  
registering   

                                                          62   
   
    

in TRACES NT. Domestic operators/traders, who do not have an EORI number may  
register   
through  one  of  the  other  identifiers  supported  by  TRACES  such  as  VAT   
number,  National   
Company   Number   or  Taxpayer   Identification   Number,   allowing   unique   and 
  individual   
identification of the operator or trader.   

7.4.     Can the system store frequently used data? (UPDATED)   

Will  it  be  possible  to  'store'  frequently  used  data  (e.g.,  frequently   
used  HS  codes  and   
scientific  names)  in  the  IS,  so  that  it  can  be  easily  auto-filled rather  
than  needing  to  be   
entered afresh for each new Due Diligence Statement?   

The Information System does not include this functionality at the moment.  
Nevertheless, it   
will  be  possible  to  duplicate  due  diligence  statements  that  have  already   
been  drafted  or   
submitted, thus reducing the time needed to fill a new statement. It will be the  
responsibility   
of  operators  and  traders  to  make  the  necessary  changes  in  the  duplicated  
statement  to   
ensure compliance.  In  addition,  an  ‘import’ button is provided, which will   
allow economic   
operators to import the information about the production place from a predefined  
GeoJSON   
file.   

7.5.     Can the system help farmers identify the geolocation? Will orthophotos or  
satellite   
  images be available for the map tool in the Information System? (UPDATED)   

The Information System acts as the repository of the due diligence statements  
submitted by   
operators and traders pursuant to Art. 4(2) and Art. 5(1)  EUDR. As such, it does  
not provide   
software or tools to identify geolocations coordinates, as it is not a primary tool  
for mapping   
﻿coordinates.   

The Information System utilizes Open Street Map (OSM) as its source for storing  
geographical   
information  related  to  various  countries  involved  in  the  system.  However,   
it  is  not  a   
comprehensive  Geographic  Information  System  (GIS)  tool  with  advanced   
features  such  as   
background satellite  images. The  system  offers  functionalities to  select,  
enter,  adjust, and   
visualise geolocation coordinates. While the Information System provides a platform  
for users   
to manage their geolocation data, users may wish to verify t he accuracy of their  
geolocation   
information using other tools and resources, including free online map services.   

7.6.     Can a due diligent statement be amended? (UPDATED)   

In accordance with Art. 5 of Commission Implementing Regulation 2024/3084, the  
withdrawal   
or amendment of a submitted due diligence statement (DDS) is possible within 72  
hours after   
the due diligence reference number has been  made available to the user by the  
Information   
System.  Withdrawal  or amendment  will  not  be  possible  if  the  DDS  reference  
number  has   
already been used in a customs declaration, referenced in another DDS, if the  
corresponding   
product has already been placed or made available on the  EU market or exported, or, 
 if the   
operator or trader was notified about the intention to carry out a check on the DDS, 
for the   
period of the check.   

                                                         63   
   
    

7.7.     Who can view the geolocation data stored in the Information System?  
(UPDATED)   

The responsible authorities that enforce the EUDR by checking the information  
submitted by   
operators  and  traders  under  this  Regulation  will  have  access  to  the   
geolocation  data   
submitted by the operators and traders. In addition, those supply chain members that 
have   
access to the DDS via reference number and verification number will have access  if  
the user   
that submitted the statement allowed to reveal the geolocation.   
﻿7.8.     Which data format is needed for the geolocation to be uploaded in the  
Information   
  System?    

Operators can provide geolocations in the Information System either by manual entry  
or by   
uploading  them  in  a  file.  The  format  of  the  supported  files  in  the   
Information  System  is   
GeoJson. The Information System supports currently WGS-84 coordinate format, with  
EPSG-  
4326 projection.   

7.9.     Is the Information System ready? (UPDATED)   

The Information System as set out in Art. 33  of the  Regulation was  launched on 4  
December   
2024.  Registration (for users of the system) opened in November 2024.   

 The  Information System will be finetuned over time as implementation advances.   

7.10.    Do I need to create a new DDS number as a downstream operator or trader if  
I only   
  handle  commodities  that  are  already  imported  into  the  EU  and  have  a   
DDS  reference   
  number? (NEW)   

Pursuant to Art. 4(8) of EUDR, the SME operators further down the supply chain do  
not have   
to exercise due diligence nor submit a DDS in the Information System for products  
that have   
already been subject to due diligence and for which a DDS have already been  
submitted. SME   
traders are also not obliged to submit DDS in the Information System. However, in  
accordance   
with Art. 4(9) of EUDR the non-SME operators and non-SME traders further down the  
supply   
chain shall submit a DDS for the relevant products they supply on the Union market  
or export,   
but  in  these  DDS,  they  may  refer  to  due  diligence  statements  that  have   
already  been   
submitted after having ascertained that due diligence has been exercised (see FAQ  
3.4.).   

7.11.    Is  the  production  system  always  available,  or  will  there  be   
recurring  downtime   
  windows? (NEW)   

The  Information  system  is  a  dedicated  domain  in  the  TRACES  infrastructure, 
 designed  to   
﻿ensure high availability and continuous accessibility. To maintain optimal  
performance, short   
maintenance  periods  are   scheduled   to  deploy   necessary   updates.   These    
updates  are   
announced in the News section due time in advance and are planned to avoid any  
impact on   
the user experience.   

                                                        64   
   
    

7.12.     What are the data entry limitations of the Due Diligence Statement? In  
other words,   
  what is the maximum content that a user can enter in a single Due Diligence   
Statement?   
  (NEW)   

A  DDS  is composed of various data fields. The product related data elements are  
organised   
and grouped together under the relevant products which are identified by HS codes. A 
single   
DDS can contain maximum 200 lines of relevant products (orange box). In each line of 
relevant   
product has the following maximum allowed limitations  are defined  500 lines to  
record the   
pairs  of  Scientific  Name(s)  /  Common  Name(s)  (blue  box),  and  1.000  lines  
to  record  the   
‘Production place’ (green box), which also contain all geolocation coordinates  
related to the   
plots of lands where the relevant product was produced in the relevant country of  
production.   
The  ‘Producer Name’  and the  ‘Production Place Description’ are optional  fields  
where the   
user  can  enter  information  for  internal  reference.  As  an  additional  rule,  
a  single  DDS  can   
contain 10.000 ‘Production Place’ in total.   

                                                                                     
                                  

Regarding reference numbers and verification numbers, each DDS can reference up to  
2.000   
other DDS.   

A registered natural or legal person in the Information System can maintain a  
maximum of 50   
DDS in Draft status at any given time.   

7.13.     Is  it  possible  to  declare  a  production  place  with  a  GeoJSON   
﻿file  that  consists  of   
  multiple coordinates in multiple countries? (NEW)   

If a relevant product is produced in multiple countries, the user must enter the  
geolocation   
coordinates separately for each country, as required by Annex II, point 3, of  EUDR. 
  

To  illustrate  this  requirement,  consider  a  product  produced  on  two  plots   
of  land,  one  in   
Belgium and one  Hungary. In this case, the user must add the production places  
separately   

                                                            65   
   
    

for each country and enter a “Production Place” with the related geolocation  
coordinates for   
the plots of land for Belgium and Hungary separately.   

                                                                                     
                                       

7.14.     How long will be data of the DDS be saved in the Information system? Is it 
necessary   
  to export and save data for purpose of archiving? (NEW)   

The storage of personal data is limited to 10 years by Art. 12(5) of Commission  
Implementing   
Regulation (EU) 2024/3084. This storage period can be further extended on the  
individual   
request of the Information system users or relevant authorities if this is necessary 
to comply   
with their responsibilities and obligations under the EUDR.  In line with this, data 
that does   
not  constitute  personal  data,  as  defined,  is  also  stored  and  accessible   
in  the  Information   
System for a period of 10 years.    

Users of the information system have the option to export the contents of a DDS into 
a PDF   
file, as well as extract geolocation coordinates into a separate file to support  
their internal   
record-keeping purposes.   

7.15.     How can geolocation coordinates be shared along the supply chain if the  
previous   
  suppliers  have  not  approved  to  share  the  geolocation  information  via  the 
 reference   
﻿  number in the Information System? (NEW)   

Art. 4(7) EUDR does not entail a legal obligation to share geolocation information  
along the   
supply chain, as ascertaining that due diligence was exercised upstream does not  
necessarily   
imply checking every single DDS upstream (see FAQ 3.4.).    

Data  sharing  among  interested  parties  is  not  confined  to  the  Information   
System.  The   
information contained in Due Diligence Statements (DDS) can be shared through other  
means   
outside of the system. Parties are free to arrange data sharing in a way that suits  
their needs,   
in compliance with applicable EU and national legislation.   

7.16.     What if the size of the DDS exceeds the maximum file size of 25 MB? (NEW)  

The  25  MB  file  limitation  allows  for  more  than  1  million  geolocation   
points,  or  polygon   
vertexes in total.   

                                                           66   
   
    

In  case  the  total  size  of  the  file  exceeds  the  25  Mb  limitation  there   
are  multiple  ways  to   
decrease the size of the files. It is recommended to provide points instead of  
polygons for   
areas lower than 4 hectares and for products in the cattle supply chain.   
Furthermore, users   
can choose a resolution which decreases the details of the approximation whilst  
remaining a   
legitimate and complete representation, by e.g. providing a point only at the  
beginning and   
end of a straight line representing a side of the area or providing significant  
corner points   
instead of points every 0.5 meters to approximate a line.   

In practice, when describing a rectangle shape, a geolocation can for example be  
described   
with 7 corner points instead of 168 corner points:   

                                                                                     
                                        

Free-to-use or commercial solutions exist to simplify  compress  polygon files.  
Furthermore,   
﻿users  should  aim  at  localising  the  origin  of  their  products  accurately,   
and  at  limiting   
declaration in excess to the minimum.  Further information  as well as workarounds  
for main   
                                                                                     
 8  
technical concerns are available in the GeoJSON file description  .   

7.17.     What if the geolocation file consists of different number of  digits than  
required by   
  the Regulation? (NEW)   

According  to  Art.  2(28)  the  geolocation  coordinates  shall  be  provided  by   
using  at  least  6   
decimal   digits   both   for   latitude   and   longitude   coordinates.   When    
the   user   uploads   
geolocation files into the Information System, the system automatically validates  
the number   
of digits. To  ensure  a  smooth data  upload  the system  provides  flexibility  by 
automatically   
adjusting to six digits, and i) if the number of the provided digits is less than 6  
then fills the   
remaining  digits  with  zeroes,  or  ii)  if  the  number  of  digits  is  more   
than  6  then  cuts  the   
irrelevant digits to reduce the file size of the uploaded file.   

7.18.      When importing or exporting products, must the net mass be declared, even 
though   
  the product is usually traded in other units? (NEW)   

In accordance with Annex II,  point 2, of EUDR, for products entering the Union  
market under   
customs procedure ‘release for free circulation’ or leaving the  Union market under  
customs   
procedure  ‘export’  the  quantity  must  be  expressed  in  kilograms  of  net   
mass  and,  where   
applicable,  in  the  supplementary unit  set  out  in Annex I to  Regulation (EEC)  
No.  2658/87.   
Supplementary units are also mandatory where they are defined consistently for all  
possible

statement.   
These values are also part of the customs declaration.   

7.19.    Can  DDS  contain  non-English  text  (e.g.,  provided  in  the  language   
of  the  Member   
  State)? (NEW)   

To  overcome  language  barriers,  besides  English,  the  Information  system  is   
available  in  all   
official EU languages.    

Many fields and options are provided in translated dropdown lists, allowing users to 
select   
information in their preferred language.  Much of the information required can be  
entered   
using numerical or coded values, minimizing the need for translation.   

To ensure smooth procedures and efficient communication with the relevant  
authorities, it is   
recommended that users use the official language of the Member State that will  
handle the   
DDS. This will facilitate clear understanding and processing of the information  
provided.   

7.20.    Is there a  need to create a separate DDS for each market to which the  
product is   
  exported? (NEW)   

When  submitting  a  DDS  for  ‘export’  there  is  no  need  to  enter  the   
destination  country.   
Therefore, there is no need to submit separate DDS in case of multiple destination  
countries.   

7.21.    Is there a  need to include the EUDR reference number in the shipping  
documents   
  such as delivery note or invoice and send the documents along with the shipments?  
Is it   
  a mandate for customs clearance for imports/exports? (NEW)   

In accordance with Art. 26(4) EUDR, the DDS reference number associated with the  
product   
which enters or leaves the Union market shall be made available to the customs  
authorities.   
To comply with this requirement,  importers or  exporters of the product  must   
include  the   
associated DDS reference numbers on the customs declaration.   
﻿Regarding other shipment documents,  including for intra-EU transport, there is no  
specific   
provision  in  the  EUDR  that  requires  the  inclusion  of  DDS  reference   
numbers  or  other   
information.   

7.22.    Does  ‘net  mass’  in  a  DDS  refer  to  the  mass  of  the  entire   
product,  or only  to  the   
  portion of relevant commodity within the product, or to the entire consignment  
(i.e. the   
  product plus pallet/packaging)? (NEW)   

For  the  purpose  of  the  DDS,  net  mass  refers  to  the  weight  of  the   
entire  product  itself,   
excluding any packaging materials (see question 2.5 about packaging). In other  
words, it is the   
weight of the product without taking into account the weight of the container,  
wrapping, or   
other packaging materials used during the transport or storage.   

7.23.    Can additional information, such as legal documents, be shared via the  
Information   
  System? (NEW)   

The EUDR Information System does not have functions to share documentation in the  
supply   
chain in addition to the data elements set out in Annex II to the EUDR.   

                                                        68   
   
    

While users can submit additional information for the attention of Competent  
Authorities,   
this information is not visible to other supply chain members who may be referencing 
this   
DDS. This means that any extra information provided by users will only be accessible 
to the   
Competent Authorities and will not be shared with other parties in the supply chain. 
  

7.24.     What is the  level of HS codes that have to be  declared  in the  
Information System?   
  (NEW)    

When drafting a DDS, the user must enter the HS codes of the products which are  
subject to   
the DDS. It is mandatory to declare the HS codes at least to the number of digits as 
listed in   
Annex I of EUDR.  Further to the mandatory level of digits, users can declare the HS 
﻿also in   
more details up to 6 digits. As an example, the HS 1201 for ‘Soya beans, whether or  
not broken’   
is selectable. However, it is possible to provide also the subheadings to 6 digits:  
  

                                                                                     
                                     

Similarly, when Annex I of EUDR contains an HS code of 6 digits, then the user  
cannot select   
HS heading of 4 or less digits.    

7.25.     Is it possible to check the validity of the DDS reference and verification 
numbers in   
  the Information System? (NEW)   

Yes, it is possible to check the validity of the DDS reference number and  
verification numbers   
within  the  Information  System.  The  interested  operator  or  trader  has  to   
log  in  into  the   
Information System and create a Draft DDS. It is to highlight that there is no need  
to submit   
the  DDS  to  use  this  function.  When  the  user  drafts  a  DDS  and  saves  it, 
 the  ‘Referenced   
Statements’ tab appears for the DDS. Under this tab the user can enter the reference 
numbers   
and verification numbers, which is also available using CSV files. Once the values  
are entered   
the system checks the validity of the DDS  reference numbers and verification  
numbers  and   
provides feedback on their validity. The content of the referenced DDS is also  
available for   
consultation at this stage  by users who are in possession of both the reference  
number and   
verification number.   

7.26.     Why is only GeoJSON format allowed for uploading geolocation data in a  
file? (NEW)   

GeoJSON is a general standard and the only non-proprietary system which allows  
submission   
of  the  extra  properties  needed,  and  where  a  very  specific  coordinate   
system  is  enforced.   
Using multiple formats in the Information System would increase the risk of  
erroneous or   
inaccurate information. The exclusive use of GeoJSON was announced in April 2024,  
allowing   
all stakeholders to prepare their respective systems accordingly.   
﻿                                                          69   
   
    

7.27.     Which list of scientific names does the Information System use?  Is it  
sufficient to   
  indicate  only  a  genus,  or  must  a  specific  species  be  mentioned?  Is  the 
 scientific  name   
  mandatory  for  all  products  under  commodity  wood,  such  as  pulp  or  paper  
products?   
  (NEW)    

Annex  II  to  the  EUDR  requires the  introduction  of  scientific  names  for   
products  from  the   
timber  supply  chain  only.  Voluntarily,  scientific  names  can  also  be   
entered  for  other   
commodities and products. The system supports the entry of scientific names with the 
use of   
the EPPO database (EPPO Global Database).    

The Regulation mentions “the common name of the species and their full scientific  
name” in   
Art.  9(1)(a),  and  the  ‘full  scientific  name ’  in  Annex  II,  point  2.  This 
 requirement  is  further   
confirmed  in  Art.  4(2)  of  Commission  Implementing  Regulation  (EU)   
2024/3084,  which   
stipulates that ‘Where a relevant product contains or has been made using wood,  
Information   
System users shall enter in the Due Diligence Statement the common names and full  
scientific   
names of the wood species which the relevant products contain or have been made  
with.’ The   
scientific  name  is  mandatory  for  all  relevant  products  listed  in  Annex  I  
to  EUDR  under   
commodity Wood. If an upstream supplier entered the scientific names of wood species 
that   
the product is made from and this DDS is used as a referenced DDS, then it is not  
necessary   
to re-enter the scientific names of relevant products.   

7.28.     Is there a need to re-enter scientific names when referencing another DDS? 
(NEW)   

As  the  upstream  supplier  entered  the  scientific  names  of  wood  species   
that  the  wood   
products  declared  are  made  from,  if  this  DDS  is  used  as  a  referenced   
DDS,  then  it  is  not   
necessary to re-enter the scientific names of relevant products.   

7.29.     What are the economic operator account requirements for a person who  
﻿performs   
  multiple roles, such as operator, trader, and acting as an authorised  
representative? Can   
  a  single  economic  operator  account  be  used  for  all  roles,  or  must  each 
 role  have  a   
  dedicated economic operator account within the Information System? (NEW)   

Within the Information System in TRACES, a single  economic operator account can be  
used   
by a natural person or a legal entity (e.g. a company), with the flexibility to add  
multiple roles   
to  that  economic  operator  account.  This  allows  the  economic  operator   
account holder  to   
perform different functions, including submitting data as an operator, trader, or  
authorised   
representative, as needed.

8.        Timelines   

8.1.      When does the Regulation enter into force and into application? (UPDATED)  

The  Regulation was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 9  
June 2023. It   
entered  into  force  on  29  June  2023  in  accordance  with  Art.  38(2)  EUDR,   
as  amended  by   
﻿Regulation   (EU)   2024/3234,   the   substantive   provisions   of   the    
Regulation   apply   from   
30  December 2025 (30 months transition). However, in accordance with Art. 38(3)  
EUDR, for   
micro- and small enterprises those provisions apply from 30 June 2026 (36 months  
transition) .   
Special rules apply to  products that are also listed in the Annex to the EUTR, see  
Art. 37 and   
Art. 38(3) EUDR.   

8.2.      What about the period between these dates? (UPDATED)   

Will  the  products  placed  on  the  Union  market  between  the  entry  into   
force  of  the   
Regulation  and  its  date(s)  of  applicability  have  to  comply  with  the   
requirements  of  the   
Regulation?   

The entry into application for large and medium enterprise operators and traders is  
foreseen   
30  months after the entry into force of the Regulation (on 30 December 2025). This  
means   
that operators and traders do not have to comply with the requirements for products  
placed   
on  the  Union  market  before  that  date.  For  small-  and  micro  undertakings   
this  period  is   
extended (36  months after the entry into force of the Regulation - on 30 June  
2026).   

8.3.      How to prove that the product was produced before the Regulation entered  
into   
  force? What are the rules for the production of cattle products?   

Who  bears  the  burden of  proof that  the  relevant  commodity or relevant   
product which   
an operator wants to place on the  EU  market or export was produced before entry  
into   
force and the Regulation does not apply?   

The Regulation is applicable as stipulated in  Art.  1(1) unless  the conditions  of 
Art.  1(2) are   
met, meaning unless  the  commodity contained in  the  product or  which has been  
used to   
make the product was produced  before 29 June 2023, as stipulated in Art. 2(14). For 
cattle,   
the  relevant  date of production  is the date  on which the cattle  is born,  
meaning that the   

                                                           71   
   
﻿    

Regulation does not apply to cattle and cattle products if the cattle was born  
before the entry   
into force.   

The  operator  bears  the  burden  of  proof  for  this  exception  and  must  be   
able  to  provide   
relevant information as reasonable proof that the conditions of Art. 1(2) of the  
Regulation are   
met. While in this case the operator is not obliged to submit a due diligence  
statement, the   
operator should  keep  necessary documents proving non-applicability of the  
Regulation and   
its obligations.

9.        Other questions   

9.1.      What are the obligations for operators and non-SME traders when they place 
on the   
  EU market or export a relevant product which is made of a relevant product or a  
relevant   
  commodity  that  was  placed  on  the  EU  market  during  the  transitional   
period  (i.e.,  the   
  period between the entry into force of the Regulation (29 June  2023) and its  
entry into   
  application (30 December 2025))? (UPDATED)   

This situation may be best explained with a few concrete scenarios:    

1.   A relevant commodity (e.g. natural rubber  -  CN code 4001) is placed on the   
EU market   
     during  the  transitional  period,  hence  not  necessarily  geolocalised,  and 
is  then used  to   
     produce a relevant derived product (e.g. new tyres - CN code 4011), which is  
then placed   
     on the  EU  market (or exported) from 30  December 2025.    

     If a commodity is placed on the  EU  market during the transitional period,  
i.e., before the   
     entry into application of the Regulation, when placing on the EU market a  
derived product   
     from 30 December 2025, the obligations of the operator (and of non-SME traders) 
will be   
﻿     limited  to  gathering  adequately  conclusive  and  verifiable  evidence  to   
prove  that  the   
     relevant commodity (rubber) used to produce such relevant product (tyres) was  
placed   
     on  the  EU  market  before  the  entry  into  application  of  the   
Regulation.  This  is  without   
     prejudice to Art. 37(2) of the Regulation with regard to timber and timber  
products. If the   
     commodity is placed on the EU market or exported after the transitional period, 
i.e., from   
     30  December  2025,  the  operator  (and  the  non-SME  traders)  will  be   
subject  to  the   
     standard obligations of the Regulation. Equally, for parts of relevant products 
that have   
     been produced with commodities placed on the  EU  market from 30 December 2025, 
the   
     operator  (and  the  non-SME  traders)  will  be  subject  to  the  standard   
obligations  of  the   
     Regulation.    

2.   A relevant product (e.g. cocoa butter -  CN code 1804) is placed on the  EU  
market during   
     the transitional period, hence not necessarily geolocalised, but is then used  
to produce   
     another relevant derived product (e.g. chocolate -  CN code 1806) which is  
placed on the   
     EU market (or exported) by a downstream operator from 30  December 2025.    

                                                           72   
   
    

     In this case, the obligations  of the operator (and of non-SME traders) placing 
on the  EU   
     market or exporting a derived product (chocolate), will be limited to gathering 
adequately   
     conclusive  and  verifiable  evidence  to  prove  that  the  relevant  derived  
product  (cocoa   
     butter) was placed on the EU market before the entry into application of the  
Regulation.   
     For  parts  of  the  final  relevant  product  that  have  been  produced  with 
 other  relevant   
     products placed on the EU  market from  30  December 2025, the operator (and  
the non-  
     SME traders) will be subject to the standard obligations of the Regulation.  
This is without   
     prejudice to Art. 37(2), with regard to timber and timber products.    

3.   An operator places on the EU market a relevant commodity or a product in the  
transitional   
﻿     period, which is then ‘made available’ on the market by one or more non-SME  
traders   
     from 30  December 2025.    

     In  this  scenario,  the  obligations  of  the  non-SME  trader  will  be   
limited  to  gathering   
     adequately conclusive and verifiable evidence to prove that such relevant  
commodity, or   
     relevant product, was placed on the  EU market before the entry into  
application of the   
     Regulation. This is without prejudice to Art. 37(2) of the Regulation, with  
regard to timber   
     and timber products.   

Specifically  for  micro  and  small  enterprises,  which  are  subject  to  the   
deferred  entry into   
application outlined in Art. 38(3)  EUDR, the following scenarios would apply:   

1.   If  an operator, qualifying as  micro and small undertaking,  places on the  EU 
market from   
     30 June 2026  a relevant product  made with a relevant commodity or relevant  
product   
     placed  on  the  EU  market  during  the  transitional  period  (from  29  June 
 2023  to  30   
     December  2025),   the  obligations  of  such  operator  would  be  limited  to 
 gathering   
     adequately conclusive and verifiable evidence to prove that the relevant  
commodity or   
     relevant product used to produce such relevant product was placed on the  EU   
market   
     before 30 December 2025. There is no need to exercise due diligence or to  
submit a DDS.   
2.   However, if the relevant product is made with a relevant commodity or a  
relevant product   
     that has  been  placed on the  EU  market after the transitional period (i.e.  
30  December   
     2025  onwards) and is accompanied by a due diligence statement, the obligations 
of an   
     operator qualifying as small or micro undertaking, and placing a relevant  
product on the   
     EU market from 30 June 2026, would be the same as those of any other operator.  

3.   If a large (or medium) company (company B) places on the EU market a product  
made of   
     a relevant commodity which was placed on the EU market by a small or micro  
undertaking   
     (company  A)  before  30  June  2026,  the  obligations  of  company  B  would  
be  limited  to   
     gathering  adequately  conclusive  and  verifiable  evidence  to  prove  that   
the  relevant   
﻿     commodity or relevant product used to produce the relevant product, was placed  
on the   
     EU market before the deferred entry into application regarding company A (i.e.  
30 June   
     2026).  In  this  case,  neither  company  A  nor  company  B  would  need  to  
carry  out  due   
     diligence or submit a DDS. The same applies in case a large or medium company  
(company   
     C)  before  company  A  in  the  supply  chain  has  placed  the  product  on   
the  market  and   
     submitted a  Due Diligence Statement  previously. The deferred entry into  
application for   

                                                        73   
   
    

     small or micro company A limits the obligations of downstream companies (such  
as large   
     or medium company B).    

9.2.     What evidence is necessary to prove that the product was placed on the  EU  
market   
   before the date of  entry into  application (i.e. what documents are accepted as  
evidence   
  of  ‘placing  on  the  market’)?  Do  such  products  need  to  be  declared  in   
the  Information   
  System? (UPDATED)   

In case of imported products, the customs declaration of the relevant commodities or 
relevant   
products in question will be accepted as evidence of having  been placed  on the  EU 
market   
before  the  date  of  application.  For  EU  produced  goods,  other  documentation 
 should  be   
accepted as evidence, for example documentation relating to the production date e.g. 
felling   
tickets,  ear  tag  and  passport  of  cattle,  invoices,  or  other  documentation  
related  to  the   
production date of the commodity. The date of placing on the  EU market can be  
supported   
e.g.  by  contracts  between  the  parties,  product  order  documents,  shipment   
accompanying   
documents about the delivery to the  customer  including  CMRs (Convention on the  
Contract   
for the International Carriage of Goods by road), bill of lading, delivery notes,  
air-way-bill, and   
any other documents showing evidence that goods are transferred between 2 parties  
which   
can be linked directly to the relevant product in question. For details on the time  
﻿of placing on   
the EU market, please refer to FAQ 5.20.    

For  products  falling  in  the  transitional  period,  no  DDS   needs  to  be   
submitted  in  the   
Information System.  In case of export or re-import of a product which was initially 
placed on   
the  EU  market during the transitional period (itself or in the form of an upstream 
relevant   
product),  a  “conventional  DDS  reference  number”,  meaning a  universal   
reference  number   
that can be entered in the customs declaration in cases of products falling in the  
transitional   
period, will be communicated by the Commission that can be used in the customs  
declaration   
submitted for export or re-import.   

9.3.     Can  products placed on the EU market during the transition period be mixed 
with   
   products that comply with the Regulation and which are  placed on the EU market  
after   
  the transition period  if it can be proven that each batch within was either  
placed on the   
   EU market during the transition period, or is compliant with the Regulation?    

Provided that all conditions detailed in Art. 3(a) -  (c)  of the Regulation  are  
fulfilled, products   
to be placed on the EU market  from  entry into application, and products placed on  
the EU   
market during the transition period (thus exempt), accompanied by evidence of having 
been   
placed on the EU market during the transition period, can be mixed together before  
being   
placed on the EU market.   

9.4.      How  will  the  mixing  of  commodities  stocked  during  the   
transitional  period  with   
  commodities to be placed on the  EU market after 30 December 2025 work in  
practice, in   
   particular in the Information System? (UPDATED)   

The  Due  Diligence  Statement  has  to  be  uploaded  to  the  Information  System  
only  for  the   
relevant products that are subject to the due diligence  obligations under the   
Regulation.  If   
operators  and  traders  mix  commodities  placed  on  the  EU  market  during  the  
transitional   

                                                        74   
   
﻿    

period  with   newer   (post-transitional   period)   stocks,   only  the    
information   relevant   to   
commodities newly placed on the  EU market should  be part of the due diligence  
statement   
as this stock is subject to the due diligence exercise.    

For “transition stocks”, see Q. above.   

9.5.     When does the transitional period start and end in practice?   

The transitional period started on the date of entry into force of the EUDR (29 June 
2023) and   
ends on the day before its entry into application.   

9.6.     How should Competent Authorities conduct checks on products which were  
placed   
  on   the   EU   market   during   the   transitional   period   to   ensure    
compliance   with   the   
  Regulation?   

Competent Authorities can carry out checks on relevant products to establish whether 
the   
products  were  placed  on  the  EU  market  during  the  transitional  period.  In  
this  case,  the   
operator bears the burden of proof to provide evidence that the product is exempted  
from   
the Regulation, in accordance with  FAQ 8.3.   

9.7.     Will the Commission issue guidelines? (UPDATED)   

The Commission  has published the  Guidance  document  in the form of Commission  
Notice   
C/2024/6789  to  elaborate  on  certain  aspects  of  the  Regulation,  e.g.  on   
the  definition  of   
“agricultural  use”,  that  will  address  issues  related  to  agroforestry  and   
agricultural  land,   
certification, legality and on other aspects that are of interest to many  
stakeholders on the   
ground.    

The Commission is also gathering inputs and promoting dialogue amongst stakeholders  
via   
the Multi-stakeholder  Platform on Protecting and Restoring the World’s Forests with 
a view   
to providing informal guidance on a number of issues. This document on Frequently  
Asked   
Questions already answers the most frequent questions received by the Commission  
from   
﻿relevant stakeholders and will be updated over time. If needed, additional  
facilitation tools   
will be mobilised.   

No  additional  guidelines  are  necessary to  comply  with  the  rules.  The   
Commission  aims  to   
elaborate  certain  aspects  to  explain  how  the  Regulation  will  work  in   
practice,  share  good   
practice examples, etc.   

9.8.     Will the Commission issue commodity-specific guidelines? (UPDATED)   

The Commission puts  forward  good practice  examples  and practical scenarios,  
including in   
the guidance document, which to some extent cover commodity-specific aspects.   

Moreover,  the  Commission  published  a  new  document providing  an overview  of   
how  the   
obligations  apply  to  supply  chains  of  the  seven  commodities  in  scope,   
depending  on  the   
company  type  (operator/trader),  size  and  position  in  the  supply  chain   
within  the  EU,   
illustrated through 10 different supply chain scenarios on our webpage:  EUDR  
compliance -   
Publications Office of the EU.   

                                                         75   
   
    

   

9.9.      What are the reporting obligations for operators?   

Operators which are not  SMEs will have to publicly report on their due diligence  
system   
annually. For those operators that are in the scope of Corporate Sustainability  
Reporting   
Directive (CSRD) and comply with EU Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) in due 
time,   
is it sufficient to publish their report according to the requirements in CSRD? Or  
will there   
be additional reporting requirements?   

The Regulation provides that when it comes to reporting obligations, operators  
falling also   
within the scope of other EU legislative instruments that lay down requirements  
regarding   
value  chain  due  diligence  may  fulfil  their  reporting  obligations  under  the 
 Regulation  by   
﻿including  the  required  information  when  reporting  in  the  context  of  other  
EU  legislative   
instruments (Art.  12(3) of the Regulation).   

9.10.     What is the EU Observatory on deforestation and forest degradation?  
(UPDATED)   

The  EU  Observatory   builds   on   already   existing   monitoring  tools,    
including   Copernicus   
products and other publicly or privately available sources, to support the  
implementation of   
this Regulation by providing scientific evidence, including land cover maps on the  
cut-off date,   
regarding   global  deforestation   and   forest   degradation   and   related   
trade.   The   use   of   
these  maps does not automatically ensure that the conditions of the Regulation are  
complied   
with, but they are a tool to help companies towards ensuring compliance with the  
Regulation,   
for example to assess the  risk that a plot of land was deforested after 2020.  
Companies are   
still obliged to carry out due diligence.   

The  EU Observatory  on deforestation  and  forest  degradation covers  all forests  
worldwide,   
including  European  forests,  and  is  developed  in  coherence  with  other   
ongoing  EU  policy   
developments  such  as  the Forest Monitoring  Law  and upgrading and enhancement of 
the   
Forest Information System for Europe (FISE).   

The  primary  purpose  of  maps  produced  by  the  EU  Observatory   is  to    
inform  the  risk   
assessment by operators/traders and  EU MS  Competent Authorities  (CAs). As such,  
maps,   
including  the  Global  Forest  Cover  map  for  the  year  2020  (see  9.10.1),   
have  the  following   
features:   

•    They are non-mandatory. There is no obligation compelling operators/traders (or 
CAs) to   
     use maps of the EU Observatory to inform their risk assessment.   

•    They  are  non-exclusive. Operators and traders (as well as CAs) may avail  
themselves of   
     other  maps  that  can  be  more  granular  or  detailed  than  those  made   
available  by  the   
     Observatory.  The  regulation  is  not  prescriptive  on  the  modalities  to   
inform  the  risk   
     assessment. The Observatory is one of the many tools which  are  available and  
﻿that the   
     Commission offers free of charge.   

•    They are non-legally  binding.  Maps made available by the EU Observatory may  
be used   
     for risk assessment. However, the fact that the geolocation provided falls  
within an area   
     considered as forest does not automatically lead to a conclusion of  
non-compliance. On   

                                                          76   
   
    

     the other hand,  it cannot be assumed that  a product will be compliant or that 
it will not   
     be checked if  its geolocation falls outside an area considered as forest  in a 
map. Reasons   
     for  this  could  be  other  risk  factors  not  covered  by  the  map,  the   
accuracy  and  spatial   
     granularity  of  the  map,  or  the  possible  non-compliance  of  the  product 
 with  relevant   
     legislation of the country of production.  Random checks will also consider  
plots of land   
     that that do not correspond to forest in the map.   

9.10.1. Can the map of Global Forest Cover for the year 2020 be used as a definitive 
source   
of  information  for  compliance  with  the  EU  Deforestation  Regulation  (EUDR),  
or  are   
additional steps and data sources required to demonstrate compliance? (NEW)   

The Commission produced a Global Forest cover map for the year 2020 (GFC 2020) as  
one of   
the support tools provided by the European Commission to implement the EUDR. Hosted  
on   
the  EU  Observatory  on  Deforestation  and  Forest  Degradation,  GFC  2020   
indicates  global   
forest cover presence/absence at 10m spatial resolution by 31 December 2020. The  
definition   
of forest in the global forest cover map of 2020 follows the definition of forest in 
the EUDR as   
defined in  Art.  2(4)  EUDR.  It should be noted  that  all plantations of relevant 
 commodities   
other than wood, i.e. cocoa, coffee, oil palm, rubber, and soya, are excluded from  
forest.  It is   
the first ever-available global map of forest cover at such fine resolution (10 m).  

Forest  cover  data  for  the  2020  cut-off  date  represents  a  key  source  of   
﻿information  for   
operators. The GFC  2020 map is one of many possible sources  (see FAQ 9.10.). Even  
though   
not legally binding, GFC 2020 could help operators comply with their obligations to  
assess the   
risk of deforestation under the EUDR.   

The GFC 2020 map can also help  EU MS competent authorities perform initial stages  
of their   
enforcement duties. Art. 18 EUDR regarding checks on operators (to be carried out by 
EU MS   
competent  authorities)  mentions  “Earth  observation  data  such  as  from  the   
Copernicus   
program” as potential data to be used for such checks (among other sources for  
verification).   
There is no mention of any specific map to be used, and competent authorities might  
want to   
use global, regional or national maps or any other source they find appropriate. GFC 
2020 is   
not intended as definitive source of information for compliance.    

9.10.2. What level of accuracy can be expected from global and national spatial  
maps, and   
can they be relied upon as a reference for due diligence and verification processes? 
(NEW)   

Errors  are  inherent  to  any  spatial  map.  Overall  accuracies  of  global   
spatial  products  are   
generally  around  85%  (depending  on  the  number  of  classes  and their  spatial 
 complexity).   
National maps may reach 90% overall accuracy. None of such global or national maps  
can be   
considered as ‘reference maps’ neither for the due diligence process nor for the  
verification   
process  due  to  their  unknown  accuracy  at  local  scale.  FAQ  9.10.4.  further 
 explains  the   
combination of complementary sources of data.   

External stakeholders that are interested in the EU Observatory’s Global Forest  
Cover map for   
the  year  2020  are  invited  to  consider  the  revised  version  of  the  map   
(version  2  dated   
December 2024) with an overall accuracy of slightly above 90%.   

                                                         77   
   
    

9.10.3.  Is a commodity automatically non-compliant if  produced on an area  
designated as   
﻿forest in the map of Global Forest Cover for the year 2020? (NEW)    

Sourcing a commodity originating from land marked as forest in the Global Forest  
Cover map   
for the year 2020 does not automatically indicate non-compliance. This may however  
indicate   
a risk of deforestation. In such cases, it is suggested to undertake further  
investigation and   
additional steps with other sources of information.    

9.10.4. Can a stakeholder use  national forest maps in conjunction with the  map of  
Global   
Forest Cover for the year 2020? (NEW)   

In  the  framework  of  the  EUDR,  forest  maps  for  year  2020  can  represent  a 
 key  source  of   
information  for  assessing  the  risk  that  a  relevant  commodity  or  a  derived 
 product  was   
produced in areas that have  been  subject  to  deforestation after  2020, in  
particular in the   
absence of alternative more accurate sources of information (see FAQ 9.10.2.).   

While there is no obligation for stakeholders to use thematic maps, analysis shows  
that the   
combination of different complementary sources of data, e.g. different forest maps,  
can   
provide useful information for an assessment of the risks of deforestation after  
2020.   

9.11 What constitutes high-risk, and how long can a suspension take place?   

Art.   17   EUDR   allows  Competent   Authorities   to   take   immediate   actions 
 –   including   
suspension - in situations that present high risk of non-compliance. What  
constitutes high-  
risk, and how long can the suspension take place?   

Competent Authorities may identify situations where relevant products present a high 
risk of   
being  non-compliant  with  the  requirements  of  the  Regulation  on  the  basis   
of  different   
circumstances, including on the spot checks, the outcome of their risk analysis in  
their  risk-  
based plans, or risks identified through the information system, or on the basis of  
information   
coming from  another  competent  authority,  substantiated  concerns  etc.  In  such 
 cases, the   
Competent  Authorities  can   introduce   interim  measures   as   defined   in    
Art.   23   of   the   
Regulation, including the suspension of placing or making available the product on  
﻿the  EU   
market.  This  suspension  should  end  within  three  working  days,  or  72  hours 
 in  case  of   
perishable products. However, the Competent Authority can come to the conclusion,  
based   
on  checks  carried  out  in  this  period  of  time,  that  the  suspension  should 
 be  extended  by   
additional periods of three days to establish if the product is compliant with the  
Regulation.   

9.12.    How does the Regulation link to the EU Renewable Energy Directive?  
(UPDATED)   

The  objectives  of  the  Regulation  and  Directive  (EU)2018/2001  as  amended  by 
 Directive   
(EU)2023/2413 (the Renewable Energy Directive –  ‘RED’)  are complementary, as they  
both   
address   the   overarching   objective   of   fighting   climate   change   and    
biodiversity   loss.   
Commodities  and  products  that  fall  within  the  scope  of  both   laws  will   
be  subject  to   
requirements  for  general  market  access  under  the  Regulation  and  may  be   
accounted  as   
renewable energy under the Renewable Energy Directive (RED),  provided that they  
comply   
with the requirements set in the RED. The  EUDR and RED requirement are compatible  
and   
mutually reinforcing. In the specific case of certification systems for low Indirect 
Land Use   
Change (ILUC) according to Commission Regulation (EU) 2019/807 supplementing  
Directive   

                                                         78   
   
    

(EU) 2018/2001, these certification systems may also be used by operators and  
traders within   
their due diligence systems to obtain information required by the  Regulation to  
meet some   
of the traceability and information requirements set out in Art.  9  of the   
Regulation. As with   
any other certification system, their use is without prejudice to the legal  
responsibility and   
obligations under the EUDR for operators and traders to exercise due diligence.   

9.13.     How are EFTA/EEA states considered in the Regulation? (NEW)   

Norway, Liechtenstein, Iceland, and Switzerland are all contracting parties  of the  
European   
﻿Free Trade Association (EFTA). As such, they are not subject to the rules of the  
Union Customs   
Code (Regulation (EU) No 952/2013). Therefore, they are not in the “customs  
territory” as   
defined in Art. 2(34) EUDR, determining them as “third countries” under the EUDR  
(Art. 2(35)   
EUDR).   

The European Economic Area (EEA) links the EU member states and three of the four  
EFTA   
States (namely Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway) into an internal market governed by  
the same   
basic rules. The EUDR has been marked as an act with EEA relevance by the EU.  It is 
currently   
under scrutiny for incorporation into the EEA Agreement by means of an EEA Joint  
Committee   
Decision (JCD) meaning that the EEA States, which are also members of EFTA, are  
considering   
whether or how EU legal acts should be incorporated into the EEA Agreement. Should  
the EEA   
States assess that the EUDR is to be incorporated into the EEA Agreement and should  
a draft   
JCD   be   adopted   subsequently   and   this   JCD   enters   in   force   after   
the   constitutional   
requirements   have   been   met,   only   then   would   the   EUDR   be    
applicable   in   Norway,   
Liechtenstein and Iceland. There is usually an inherent backlog of up to several  
years as the   
incorporation procedure only starts after the act has been published and due to the  
complex   
procedures to incorporate the act into the EEA Agreement and into the legal systems  
of the   
EEA States.    

Therefore, for now, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland are considered third countries 
under   
the EUDR.   

Switzerland did not join the EEA, therefore the above does not apply to Switzerland, 
meaning   
the EUDR applies to Switzerland and operators established there  in the same way as  
it does   
for other third countries and third country operators.   

   

                                                          °°°°   

                                                               
﻿10.       Penalties   

                                                           79   
   
    

10.1.    What  does  it  mean  that  the  penalties  laid  down  by  the  EU  Member 
 States  are   
  without prejudice to the obligations of Member States under Directive 2008/99/EC  
of the   
   European Parliament and of the Council? (UPDATED)   

The  EU  Member  States  must  lay down the  national framework of penalties, which  
should   
include at least the penalties listed in Art. 25(2) of the Regulation and must take  
all measures   
necessary to ensure that the rules are implemented. The level and type of  penalties 
 cannot   
be in contradiction with the Environmental Crime Directive. The provisions of the  
Directive   
are subject to the succession of law.    

10.2.    What is the maximum level of fine?    

Member States have the discretion to define the penalties, including the level of  
fine. For legal   
persons the maximum  level  of  the  penalty cannot be lower than 4 % of the  
operator’s or   
trader’s total annual Union-wide turnover in the financial year preceding the fining 
decision,   
calculated  in  accordance  with  the  calculation  of  aggregate  turnover  for   
undertakings  laid   
down in Art. 5(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004.   

The   level   of   fine   should   increase   where   necessary,   particularly   in 
  case   of   repeated   
infringements. The penalties should ensure that they effectively deprive those  
responsible of   
the economic benefits derived from their  infringements, in accordance with the   
effective,   
proportionate, and dissuasive principle.   

10.3.    With  regards  to  the  Public  Procurement  Directive,  is  it  for  EU   
Member  States  to   
  decide, when implementing the Regulation, whether self-cleaning should be enabled? 
   

Apart   from   the   requirements   of   Art.   25(1)   and   (2)   EUDR,   Member   
States   will   have   
discretionary power to decide upon whether they want to provide for self-cleaning or 
﻿not.   
However, they would need to ensure that such a provision does not impede the  
effectiveness   
of the penalties by setting and applying clear rules on self-cleaning.   

10.4.    According to Art. 25(3) EUDR, “Member States shall notify the Commission of 
final   
  judgments” and penalties imposed on legal persons. The Commission will publish a  
list of   
  these judgments on its website. Does this refer to all administrative decisions or 
to court   
   rulings?   

This   provision   means  that  Member   States   should  notify   the   Commission  
 about  final   
judgements against legal persons, which means Court rulings.   

10.5.     I have cut down a few small trees on my property where I now raise some  
cows. I   
   intend to sell the timber and the meat of the cows on a local market in the EU.  
Will there   
   be penalties imposed on me for selling them as I cut the trees? (UPDATED)   

Generally, the responsibility for enforcement of the provisions lies with the Member 
States.   
Requiring operators and traders to take corrective measures, as stipulated in Art.  
24 EUDR,   
falls under the discretion of Competent Authorities of Member States. In the EU, the 
principle   
of  proportionality  is  one  of  the  general  principles  of  Union  law  which   
applies  to  the   
interpretation and enforcement of Union legislation.    

                                                         80   
   
    

Cutting down trees can only constitute a breach of the deforestation-free  
requirement under   
the  Regulation  if the trees are part of a forest as defined in the Regulation.  
This is the case if   
the trees are part of land which is not under predominantly agricultural or urban  
land use   
spanning more than 0,5 hectares with trees higher than 5 metres and a canopy cover  
of more   
than 10 %, or trees able to reach those thresholds i n situ. If one of these  
criteria is not met,   
the area is not a forest and the cutting  down the trees  does not  breach a  
provision  of the   
deforestation-free requirement of the  Regulation.
